Preface
With the 33rd edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 we continue our commitment to providing students with 
the most useful and up-to-date preparation guide for this exam. This edition represents an outstanding revision in 
many ways, including:
 
� 73 entirely new or heavily revised high-yield topics reflecting evolving trends in the USMLE Step 1. 
 
� Extensive text revisions, new mnemonics, clarifications, and corrections curated by a team of 19 medical student 
and resident physician authors who excelled on their Step 1 examinations, and verified by a team of expert 
faculty advisors and nationally recognized USMLE instructors. 
 
� Updated with 148 new and revised diagrams and illustrations as part of our ongoing collaboration with 
USMLE-Rx and ScholarRx (MedIQ Learning, LLC). 
 
� Updated with 159 new and revised photos to help visualize various disorders, descriptive findings, and basic 
science concepts. Additionally, revised imaging photos have been labeled and optimized to show both normal 
anatomy and pathologic findings. 
 
� Updated exam preparation advice for the current pass/fail scoring system of the USMLE Step 1, and Step 1 
blueprint changes. 
 
� Updated photos of patients and pathologies to include a variety of skin colors to better depict real-world 
presentations. 
 
� Revised pharmacology sections to include only those drugs currently approved for the US market.
 
� Improved organization and integration of text, illustrations, clinical images, and tables throughout for focused 
review of high-yield topics.
 
� Updated Rapid Review section to better reflect exam contents by removing the ‘Classic/Relevant Treatments’ 
section and adding in a ‘Pathophysiology of Important Diseases’ section.
 
� Revised ratings of current, high-yield review resources, with clear explanations of their relevance to USMLE 
review. Replaced outdated resources with new ones recommended by Step takers.
 
� Real-time Step 1 updates and corrections can be found exclusively on our blog, www.firstaidteam.com.
We invite students and faculty to share their thoughts and ideas to help us continually improve First Aid for the 
USMLE Step 1 through our blog and collaborative editorial platform. (See How to Contribute, p. xv.)

General Acknowledgments
xv 
This edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 incorporates thousands of contributions and improvements suggested 
by student and faculty advisors. We invite you to participate in this process. Please send us your suggestions for:
 
� Study and test-taking strategies for the USMLE Step 1
 
� New facts, mnemonics, diagrams, and clinical images
 
� High-yield topics that may appear on future Step 1 exams
 
� Personal ratings and comments on review books, question banks, apps, videos, and courses
 
� Pathology and radiology images (high resolution) relevant to the facts in the book
For each new entry incorporated into the next edition, you will receive up to a $20 Amazon.com gift card as well as 
personal acknowledgment in the next edition. Significant contributions will be compensated at the discretion of the 
authors. Also, let us know about material in this edition that you feel is low yield and should be deleted. 
All submissions including potential errata should ideally be supported with hyperlinks to a dynamically updated Web 
resource such as UpToDate, AccessMedicine, and ClinicalKey.
We welcome potential errata on grammar and style if the change improves readability. Please note that First Aid style 
is somewhat unique; for example, we have fully adopted the AMA Manual of Style recommendations on eponyms 
(“We recommend that the possessive form be omitted in eponymous terms”) and on abbreviations (no periods with 
eg, ie, etc). We also avoid periods in tables unless required for full sentences. Kindly refrain from submitting “style 
errata” unless you find specific inconsistencies with the AMA Manual of Style or our diversity initiative as discussed 
in the Foreword.
The preferred way to submit new entries, clarifications, mnemonics, or potential corrections with a valid, 
authoritative reference is via our website: www.firstaidteam.com.
This website will be continuously updated with validated errata, new high-yield content, and a new online platform 
to contribute suggestions, mnemonics, diagrams, clinical images, and potential errata.
Alternatively, you can email us at: firstaid@scholarrx.com.
Contributions submitted by May 15, 2023, receive priority consideration for the 2024 edition of First Aid for the 
USMLE Step 1. We thank you for taking the time to share your experience and apologize in advance that we cannot 
individually respond to all contributors as we receive thousands of contributions each year.
How to Contribute

` NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS
All contributions become property of the authors and are subject to editing and reviewing. Please verify all data and 
spellings carefully. Contributions should be supported by at least two high-quality references.
Check our website first to avoid duplicate submissions. In the event that similar or duplicate entries are received, 
only the first complete entry received with valid, authoritative references will be credited. Please follow the style, 
punctuation, and format of this edition as much as possible.
 
` JOIN THE FIRST AID TEAM
The First Aid/ScholarRx team is pleased to offer paid editorial and coaching positions. We are looking for passionate,

and developing the software that supports our crowdsourcing platform. We welcome people with prior experience 
and talent in these areas. Relevant skills include clinical imaging, digital photography, digital asset management, 
information design, medical illustration, graphic design, tutoring, and software development. 
xvii 
How to Use This Book
CONGRATULATIONS: You now possess the book that has guided nearly two million students to USMLE success 
for over 30 years. With appropriate care, the binding should last the useful life of the book. Keep in mind that putting 
excessive flattening pressure on any binding will accelerate its failure. If you purchased a book that you believe 
is defective, please immediately return it to the place of purchase. If you encounter ongoing issues, you can also 
contact Customer Service at our publisher, McGraw Hill.
START EARLY: Use this book as early as possible while learning the basic medical sciences. The first semester of 
your first year is not too early! Devise a study plan by reading Section I: Guide to Efficient Exam Preparation, and 
make an early decision on resources to use by checking Section IV: Top-Rated Review Resources. Note that First Aid 
is neither a textbook nor a comprehensive review book, and it is not a panacea for inadequate preparation. 
CONSIDER FIRST AID YOUR ANNOTATION HUB: Annotate this book with material from other resources, 
such as class notes or comprehensive textbooks. This will keep all the high-yield information you need in one place. 
Other tips on keeping yourself organized:
 
� For best results, use fine-tipped ballpoint pens (eg, BIC Pro+, Uni-Ball Jetstream Sports, Pilot Drawing Pen, 
Zebra F-301). If you like gel pens, try Pentel Slicci, and for markers that dry almost immediately, consider 
Staedtler Triplus Fineliner, Pilot Drawing Pen, and Sharpies.
 
� Consider using pens with different colors of ink to indicate different sources of information (eg, blue for 
USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax, green for UWorld Step 1 Qbank, red for Rx Bricks).
 
� Choose highlighters that are bright and dry quickly to minimize smudging and bleeding through the page 
(eg, Tombow Kei Coat, Sharpie Gel).
 
� Many students de-spine their book and get it 3-hole-punched. This will allow you to insert materials from other 
sources, including curricular materials. 
INTEGRATE STUDY WITH CASES, FLASH CARDS, AND QUESTIONS: To broaden your learning strategy, 
consider integrating your First Aid study with case-based reviews (eg, First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1), flash 
cards (eg, USMLE-Rx Step 1 Flash Facts), and practice questions (eg, the USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax). Read the 
chapter in the book, then test your comprehension by using cases, flash cards, and questions that cover the same 
topics. Maintain access to more comprehensive resources (eg, ScholarRx Bricks and USMLE-Rx Step 1 Express 
videos) for deeper review as needed.
PRIME YOUR MEMORY: Return to your annotated Sections II and III several days before taking the USMLE 
Step 1. The book can serve as a useful way of retaining key associations and keeping high-yield facts fresh in your 
memory just prior to the exam. The Rapid Review section includes high-yield topics to help guide your studying.
CONTRIBUTE TO FIRST AID: Reviewing the book immediately after your exam can help us improve the next 
edition. Decide what was truly high and low yield and send us your comments. Feel free to send us scanned images 
from your annotated First Aid book as additional support. Of course, always remember that all examinees are under 
agreement with the NBME to not disclose the specific details of copyrighted test material.

` INTRODUCTION
Relax.
This section is intended to make your exam preparation easier, not harder. 
Our goal is to reduce your level of anxiety and help you make the most 
of your efforts by helping you understand more about the United States 
Medical Licensing Examination, Step 1 (USMLE Step 1). As a medical 
student, you are no doubt familiar with taking standardized examinations 
and quickly absorbing large amounts of material. When you first confront 
the USMLE Step 1, however, you may find it all too easy to become 
sidetracked from your goal of studying with maximal effectiveness. Common 
mistakes that students make when studying for Step 1 include the following:
 
� Starting to study (including First Aid) too late
 
� Starting to study intensely too early and burning out
 
� Starting to prepare for boards before creating a knowledge foundation
 
� Using inefficient or inappropriate study methods
 
� Buying the wrong resources or buying too many resources
 
� Buying only one publisher’s review series for all subjects
 
� Not using practice examinations to maximum benefit
 
� Not understanding how scoring is performed or what the result means
 
� Not using review books along with your classes
 
� Not analyzing and improving your test-taking strategies
 
� Getting bogged down by reviewing difficult topics excessively
 
� Studying material that is rarely tested on the USMLE Step 1
 
� Failing to master certain high-yield subjects owing to overconfidence
 
� Using First Aid as your sole study resource
 
� Trying to prepare for it all alone
In this section, we offer advice to help you avoid these pitfalls and be more 
productive in your studies.
 
` USMLE STEP 1—THE BASICS
The USMLE Step 1 is the first of three examinations that you would 
normally pass in order to become a licensed physician in the United 
States. The USMLE is a joint endeavor of the National Board of Medical 
Examiners (NBME) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). 
The USMLE serves as the single examination system domestically and 
internationally for those seeking medical licensure in the United States.
The Step 1 exam includes test items that can be grouped by the organiza-
tional constructs outlined in Table 1 (in order of tested frequency). In late 
2020, the USMLE increased the number of items assessing communication 
skills. While pharmacology is still tested, they are focusing on drug mecha-
nisms rather than on pharmacotherapy. You will not be required to identify 
the specific medications indicated for a specific condition. Instead, you will 
be asked more about drug mechanisms and side effects.
 ` The test at a glance:
 � 8-hour exam
 � Up to a total of 280 multiple choice items
 � 7 test blocks (60 min/block)
 � Up to 40 test items per block
 � 45 minutes of break time, plus another 15 
if you skip the tutorial

How Is the Computer-Based Test (CBT) Structured?
The CBT Step 1 exam consists of one “optional” tutorial/simulation block 
and seven “real” question blocks of up to 40 questions per block with no 
more than 280 questions in total, timed at 60 minutes per block. A short 
11-question survey follows the last question block. The computer begins the 
survey with a prompt to proceed to the next block of questions. 
Once an examinee finishes a particular question block on the CBT, he or 
she must click on a screen icon to continue to the next block. Examinees 
cannot go back and change their answers to questions from any previously 
completed block. However, changing answers is allowed within a block of 
questions as long as the block has not been ended and if time permits.
What Is the CBT Like?
Given the unique environment of the CBT, it’s important that you become 
familiar ahead of time with what your test-day conditions will be like. You 
can access a 15-minute tutorial and practice blocks at http://orientation.
nbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1. This tutorial interface is the same as 
the one you will use in the exam; learn it now and you can skip taking it 
during the exam, giving you up to 15 extra minutes of break time. You can 
gain experience with the CBT format by taking the 120 practice questions (3 
blocks with 40 questions each) available online for free (https://www.usmle.
org/prepare-your-exam) or by signing up for a practice session at a test center 
for a fee.

For security reasons, examinees are not allowed to bring any personal 
electronic equipment into the testing area. This includes both digital and 
analog watches, cell phones, tablets, and calculators. Examinees are also 
prohibited from carrying in their books, notes, pens/pencils, and scratch 
paper (laminated note boards and fine-tip dry erase pens will be provided 
for use within the testing area). Food and beverages are also prohibited 
in the testing area. The testing centers are monitored by audio and video 
surveillance equipment. However, most testing centers allot each examinee 
a small locker outside the testing area in which he or she can store snacks, 
beverages, and personal items.
Questions are typically presented in multiple choice format, with 4 or more 
possible answer options. There is a countdown timer on the lower left corner 
of the screen as well. There is also a button that allows the examinee to mark 
a question for review. If a given question happens to be longer than the 
screen, a scroll bar will appear on the right, allowing the examinee to see the 
rest of the question. Regardless of whether the examinee clicks on an answer 
choice or leaves it blank, he or she must click the “Next” button to advance 
to the next question.
The USMLE features a small number of media clips in the form of audio 
and/or video. There may even be a question with a multimedia heart sound 
simulation. In these questions, a digital image of a torso appears on the 
screen, and the examinee directs a digital stethoscope to various auscultation 
points to listen for heart and breath sounds. The USMLE orientation 
materials include several practice questions in these formats. During the 
exam tutorial, examinees are given an opportunity to ensure that both the 
audio headphones and the volume are functioning properly. If you are 
already familiar with the tutorial and planning on skipping it, first skip ahead 
to the section where you can test your headphones. After you are sure the 
headphones are working properly, proceed to the exam.
The examinee can call up a window displaying normal laboratory values. 
In order to do so, he or she must click the “Lab” icon on the top part of 
the screen. Afterward, the examinee will have the option to choose between 
“Blood,” “Cerebrospinal,” “Hematologic,” or “Sweat and Urine.” The 
normal values screen may obscure the question if it is expanded. The 
examinee may have to scroll down to search for the needed lab values. You 
might want to memorize some common lab values so you spend less time on 
questions that require you to analyze these.
The CBT interface provides a running list of questions on the left part of the 
screen at all times. The software also permits examinees to highlight or cross 
out information by using their mouse. There is a “Notes” icon on the top 
part of the screen that allows students to write notes to themselves for review 
at a later time. Finally, the USMLE has recently added new functionality 
including text magnification and reverse color (white text on black 
background). Being familiar with these features can save time and may help 
you better view and organize the information you need to answer a question.
 ` Keyboard shortcuts: 
 � A, B, etc—letter choices
 � Esc—exit pop-up Calculator and Notes 
windows
 ` Be sure to test your headphones during the 
tutorial.
 ` Heart sounds are tested via media questions. 
Make sure you know how different heart 
diseases sound on auscultation.
 ` Illustrations on the test include:
 � Gross specimen photos
 � Histology slides
 � Medical imaging (eg, x-ray, CT, MRI)
 � Electron micrographs
 � Line drawings
 ` Familiarize yourself with the commonly 
tested lab values (eg, Hb, WBC, Ca2+, Na+, 
K+).

For those who feel they might benefit, the USMLE offers an opportunity 
to take a simulated test, or “CBT Practice Session” at a Prometric center. 
Students are eligible to register for this three-and-one-half-hour practice 
session after they have received their scheduling permit.
The same USMLE Step 1 sample test items (120 questions) available 
on the USMLE website are used at these sessions. No new items will be 
presented. The practice session is available at a cost of $75 ($155 if taken 
outside of the US and Canada) and is divided into a short tutorial and three 
1-hour blocks of ~40 test items each. Students receive a printed percent-
correct score after completing the session. No explanations of questions are 
provided.
You may register for a practice session online at www.usmle.org. A separate 
scheduling permit is issued for the practice session. Students should allow 
two weeks for receipt of this permit.
How Do I Register to Take the Exam?
Prometric test centers offer Step 1 on a year-round basis, except for the first 
two weeks in January and major holidays. Check with the test center you 
want to use before making your exam plans.
US students can apply to take Step 1 at the NBME website. This application 
allows you to select one of 12 overlapping three-month blocks in which to be 
tested (eg, April–May–June, June–July–August). Choose your three-month 
eligibility period wisely. If you need to reschedule outside your initial three-
month period, you can request a one-time extension of eligibility for the next 
contiguous three-month period, and pay a rescheduling fee. The application 
also includes a photo ID form that must be certified by an official at your 
medical school to verify your enrollment. After the NBME processes your 
application, it will send you a scheduling permit.
The scheduling permit you receive from the NBME will contain your USMLE 
identification number, the eligibility period in which you may take the exam, 
and two additional numbers. The first of these is known as your “scheduling 
number.” You must have this number in order to make your exam appointment 
with Prometric. The second number is known as the “candidate identification 
number,” or CIN. Examinees must enter their CINs at the Prometric 
workstation in order to access their exams. However, you will not be allowed 
to bring your permit into the exam and will be asked to copy your CIN onto 
your scratch paper. Prometric has no access to the codes. Make sure to bring 
a paper or electronic copy of your permit with you to the exam! Also bring 
an unexpired, government-issued photo ID that includes your signature (such 
as a  driver’s license or passport). Make sure the name on your photo ID exactly 
matches the name that appears on your scheduling permit.
 ` You can take a shortened CBT practice test at 
a Prometric center.
 ` The Prometric website will display a calendar 
with open test dates.
Section i Guide to efficient exam PreParation 
6
Once you receive your scheduling permit, you may access the Prometric 
website or call Prometric’s toll-free number to arrange a time to take the 
exam. You may contact Prometric two weeks before the test date if you 
want to confirm identification requirements. Be aware that your exam may 
be canceled because of circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
or other unforeseen events. If that were to happen, you should receive an 
email from Prometric containing notice of the cancellation and instructions 
on rescheduling. Visit www.prometric.com for updates regarding their 
COVID-19 cancellation and rescheduling policies.
Although requests for taking the exam may be completed more than six months 
before the test date, examinees will not receive their scheduling permits earlier 
than six months before the eligibility period. The eligibility period is the three-
month period you have chosen to take the exam. Most US medical students 
attending a school which uses the two-year preclerkship curriculum choose 
the April–June or June–August period. Most US medical students attending 
a school which uses the 18-month preclerkship curriculum choose the 
December–February or January–March period.
What If I Need to Reschedule the Exam?
You can change your test date and/or center by contacting Prometric at 
1-800-MED-EXAM (1-800-633-3926) or www.prometric.com. Make sure to 
have your CIN when rescheduling. If you are rescheduling by phone, you must 
speak with a Prometric representative; leaving a voicemail message will not 
suffice. To avoid a rescheduling fee, you will need to request a change at least 
31 calendar days before your appointment. Please note that your rescheduled 
test date must fall within your assigned three-month eligibility period.
When Should I Register for the Exam?
You should plan to register as far in advance as possible ahead of your 
desired test date (eg, six months), but, depending on your particular test 
center, new dates and times may open closer to the date. Scheduling early 
will guarantee that you will get either your test center of choice or one 
within a 50-mile radius of your first choice. For most US medical students, 
the desired testing window correlates with the end of the preclerkship 
curriculum, which is around June for schools on a two-year preclerkship 
schedule, and around January for schools on an 18-month schedule. Thus 
US medical students should plan to register before January in anticipation of 
a June test date, or before August in anticipation of a January test date. The 
timing of the exam is more flexible for IMGs, as it is related only to when 
they finish exam preparation. Talk with upperclassmen who have already 
taken the test so you have real-life experience from students who went 
through a similar curriculum, then formulate your own strategy.
 ` Be familiar with Prometric’s policies for 
cancellation and rescheduling due to 
COVID-19.
 ` Test scheduling is done on a “first-come, 
first-served” basis. It’s important to schedule 
an exam date as soon as you receive your 
scheduling permit.
 ` Register six months in advance for seating 
and scheduling preference.

Where Can I Take the Exam?
Your testing location is arranged with Prometric when you book your test 
date (after you receive your scheduling permit). For a list of Prometric 
locations nearest you, visit www.prometric.com.
How Long Will I Have to Wait Before I Get My Result?
The USMLE reports results in three to four weeks, unless there are delays 
in processing. Examinees will be notified via email when their results are 
available. By following the online instructions, examinees will be able 
to view, download, and print their exam report online for ~120 days after 
notification, after which results can only be obtained through requesting an 
official USMLE transcript. Additional information about results reporting 
timetables and accessibility is available on the official USMLE website. 
Between 2020 and 2021, Step 1 pass rates dropped from 97% to 95% across 
US/Canadian schools and from 83% to 77% across non-US/Canadian 
schools (see Table 2).
What About Time?
Time is of special interest on the CBT exam. Here’s a breakdown of the 
exam schedule:
15 minutes  
 Tutorial (skip if familiar with test format and features)
7 hours  
Seven 60-minute question blocks
45 minutes 
Break time (includes time for lunch)
The computer will keep track of how much time has elapsed on the exam. 
However, the computer will show you only how much time you have 
remaining in a given block. Therefore, it is up to you to determine if you 
are pacing yourself properly (at a rate of approximately one question per 90 
seconds).
The computer does not warn you if you are spending more than your allotted 
time for a break. You should therefore budget your time so that you can take a 
short break when you need one and have time to eat. You must be especially 
careful not to spend too much time in between blocks (you should keep track 
of how much time elapses from the time you finish a block of questions to the 
time you start the next block). After you finish one question block, you’ll need 
to click to proceed to the next block of questions. If you do not click within 
30 seconds, you will automatically be entered into a break period.
Break time for the day is 45 minutes, but you are not required to use all of 
it, nor are you required to use any of it. You can gain extra break time (but 
not extra time for the question blocks) by skipping the tutorial or by finishing 
a block ahead of the allotted time. Any time remaining on the clock when 
you finish a block gets added to your remaining break time. Once a new 
question block has been started, you may not take a break until you have 
reached the end of that block. If you do so, this will be recorded as an 
“unauthorized break” and will be reported on your final exam report. 
 ` Gain extra break time by skipping the 
tutorial, or utilize the tutorial time to add 
personal notes to your scratch paper.
 ` Be careful to watch the clock on your break 
time.
Section i Guide to efficient exam PreParation 
8
Finally, be aware that it may take a few minutes of your break time to “check 
out” of the secure resting room and then “check in” again to resume testing, 
so plan accordingly. The “check-in” process may include fingerprints, 
pocket checks, and metal detector scanning. Some students recommend 
pocketless clothing on exam day to streamline the process.
If I Freak Out and Leave, What Happens to My Exam?
Your scheduling permit shows a CIN that you will need to enter to start your 
exam. Entering the CIN is the same as breaking the seal on a test book, and 
you are considered to have started the exam when you do so. However, no 
result will be reported if you do not complete the exam. If you leave at any 
time after starting the test, or do not open every block of your test, your test 
will not be scored and will be reported as incomplete. Incomplete results 
count toward the maximum of four attempts for each Step exam. Although 
a pass or fail result is not posted for incomplete tests, examinees may still be 
offered an option to request that their scores be calculated and reported if 
they desire; unanswered questions will be scored as incorrect.
The exam ends when all question blocks have been completed or when 
their time has expired. As you leave the testing center, you will receive a 
printed test-completion notice to document your completion of the exam. 
To receive an official score, you must finish the entire exam.
What Types of Questions Are Asked?
All questions on the exam are one-best-answer multiple choice items. 
Most questions consist of a clinical scenario or a direct question followed 
by a list of four or more options. You are required to select the single best

answer among the options given. There are no “except,” “not,” or matching 
questions on the exam. A number of options may be partially correct, in 
which case you must select the option that best answers the question or 
completes the statement. Additionally, keep in mind that experimental 
questions may appear on the exam, which do not affect your exam result.
How Is the Test Scored?
The USMLE transitioned to a pass/fail scoring system for Step 1 on January 26, 
2022. Examinees now receive an electronic report that will display the outcome 
of either “Pass” or “Fail.” Failing reports include a graphic depiction of the 
distance between the examinee’s score and the minimum passing standard 
as well as content area feedback. Feedback for the content area shows the 
examinee’s performance relative to examinees with a low pass (lower, same, or 
higher) and should be used to guide future study plans. Passing exam reports 
only displays the outcome of “Pass,” along with a breakdown of topics covered 
on that individual examination (which will closely mirror the frequencies listed 
in Table 1). Note that a number of questions are experimental and are not 
counted toward or against the examinee’s performance.
Examinees who took the test before the transition to pass/fail reporting received 
an electronic report that includes the examinee’s pass/fail status, a three- 
digit test score, a bar chart comparing the examinee’s performance in each 
content area with their overall Step 1 performance, and a graphic depiction 
of the examinee’s performance by physician task, discipline, and organ system. 
Changes will not be made to transcripts containing three-digit test scores.
The USMLE does not report the minimum number of correct responses 
needed to pass, but estimates that it is approximately 60%. The USMLE 
may update exam result reporting in the future, so please check the USMLE 
website or www.firstaidteam.com for updates.
Official NBME/USMLE Resources
The NBME offers a Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) for 
practice that is a shorter version of the Step 1. The CBSE contains four blocks 
of 50 questions each and covers material that is typically learned during the 
basic science years. CBSE scores represent the percent of content mastered and 
show an estimated probability of passing Step 1. Many schools use this test to 
gauge whether a student is expected to pass Step 1. If this test is offered by your 
school, it is usually conducted at the end of regular didactic time before any 
dedicated Step 1 preparation. If you do not encounter the CBSE before your 
dedicated study time, you need not worry about taking it. Use the information 
to help set realistic goals and timetables for your success. 
 ` Depending on the resource used, practice 
questions may be easier than the actual 
exam.
Section i Guide to efficient exam PreParation 
10
The NBME also offers six forms of Comprehensive Basic Science Self-
Assessment (CBSSA). Students who prepared for the exam using this web-
based tool reported that they found the format and content highly indicative 
of questions tested on the actual exam. In addition, the CBSSA is a fair 
predictor of historical USMLE performance. The test interface, however, 
does not match the actual USMLE test interface, so practicing with these 
forms alone is not advised.
The CBSSA exists in two formats: standard-paced and self-paced, both of 
which consist of four sections of 50 questions each (for a total of 200 multiple 
choice items). The standard-paced format allows the user up to 75 minutes 
to complete each section, reflecting time limits similar to the actual exam. 
By contrast, the self-paced format places a 5-hour time limit on answering all 
multiple choice questions. Every few years, new forms are released and older 
ones are retired, reflecting changes in exam content. Therefore, the newer 
exams tend to be more similar to the actual Step 1, and scores from these 
exams tend to provide a better estimation of exam day performance. 
Keep in mind that this bank of questions is available only on the web. The 
NBME requires that users start and complete the exam within 90 days of 
purchase. Once the assessment has begun, users are required to complete 
the sections within 20 days. Following completion of the questions, the 
CBSSA provides a performance profile indicating the user’s relative 
strengths and weaknesses, much like the report profile for the USMLE Step 
1 exam. In addition to the performance profile, examinees will be informed 
of the number of questions answered incorrectly. You will have the ability 
to review the text of all questions with detailed explanations. The NBME 
charges $60 for each assessment, payable by credit card or money order. For 
more information regarding the CBSE and the CBSSA, visit the NBME’s 
website at www.nbme.org.
The NBME scoring system is weighted for each assessment exam. While 
some exams seem more difficult than others, the equated percent correct 
reported takes into account these inter-test differences. Also, while 
many students report seeing Step 1 questions “word-for-word” out of the 
assessments, the NBME makes special note that no live USMLE questions 
are shown on any NBME assessment.
Lastly, the International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) offers a Basic 
Science Examination (BSE) practice exam at participating Prometric test 
centers for $200. Students may also take the self-assessment test online for 
$35 through the NBME’s website. The IFOM BSE is intended to determine 
an examinee’s relative areas of strength and weakness in general areas of 
basic science—not to predict performance on the USMLE Step 1 exam—
and the content covered by the two examinations is somewhat different. 
However, because there is substantial overlap in content coverage and many 
IFOM items were previously used on the USMLE Step 1, it is possible to 
roughly project IFOM performance onto the historical USMLE Step 1 
score scale. More information is available at http://www.nbme.org/ifom/.

` LEARNING STRATEGIES
Many students feel overwhelmed during the preclinical years and struggle to 
find an effective learning strategy. Table 3 lists several learning strategies you 
can try and their estimated effectiveness for Step 1 preparation based on the 
literature (see References). These are merely suggestions, and it’s important 
to take your learning preferences into account. Your comprehensive 
learning approach will contain a combination of strategies (eg, elaborative 
interrogation followed by practice testing, mnemonics review using spaced 
repetition, etc). Regardless of your choice, the foundation of knowledge 
you build during your basic science years is the most important resource for 
success on the USMLE Step 1.

HIGH EFFICACY
Practice Testing
Also called “retrieval practice,” practice testing has both direct and indirect 
benefits to the learner.4 Effortful retrieval of answers does not only identify 
weak spots—it directly strengthens long-term retention of material.5 The 
more effortful the recall, the better the long-term retention. This advantage 
has been shown to result in higher test scores and GPAs.6 In fact, research 
has shown a positive correlation between the number of boards-style practice 
questions completed and Step 1 performance among medical students.7
Practice testing should be done with “interleaving” (mixing of questions 
from different topics in a single session). Question banks often allow you to 
intermingle topics. Interleaved practice helps learners develop their ability to 
focus on the relevant concept when faced with many possibilities. Practicing 
topics in massed fashion (eg, all cardiology, then all dermatology) may seem 
intuitive, but there is strong evidence that interleaving correlates with longer-
term retention and increased student achievement, especially on tasks that 
involve problem solving.5 
In addition to using question banks, you can test yourself by arranging your 
notes in a question-answer format (eg, via flash cards). Testing these Q&As in 
random order allows you to reap the benefit of interleaved practice. Bear in 
mind that the utility of practice testing comes from the practice of information 
retrieval, so simply reading through Q&As will attenuate this benefit.
Distributed Practice
Also called “spaced repetition,” distributed practice is the opposite of massed 
practice or “cramming.” Learners review material at increasingly spaced out 
intervals (days to weeks to months). Massed learning may produce more 
short-term gains and satisfaction, but learners who use distributed practice 
have better mastery and retention over the long term.5,9
Flash cards are a simple way to incorporate both distributed practice and 
practice testing. Studies have linked spaced repetition learning with flash 
cards to improved long-term knowledge retention and higher exam scores.6,8,10 
Apps with automated spaced-repetition software (SRS) for flash cards exist for 
smartphones and tablets, so the cards are accessible anywhere. Proceed with 
caution: there is an art to making and reviewing cards. The ease of quickly 
downloading or creating digital cards can lead to flash card overload (it is 
unsustainable to make 50 flash cards per lecture!). Even at a modest pace, 
the thousands upon thousands of cards are too overwhelming for Step 1 
preparation. Unless you have specific high-yield cards (and have checked 
the content with high-yield resources), stick to pre-made cards by reputable 
sources that curate the vast amount of knowledge for you. 
If you prefer pen and paper, consider using a planner or spreadsheet to 
organize your study material over time. Distributed practice allows for

term knowledge retention and higher exam 
scores.

some forgetting of information, and the added effort of recall over time 
strengthens the learning.
MODERATE EFFICACY
Mnemonics
A “mnemonic” refers to any device that assists memory, such as acronyms, 
mental imagery (eg, keywords with or without memory palaces), etc. Keyword 
mnemonics have been shown to produce superior knowledge retention 
when compared with rote memorization in many scenarios. However, they 
are generally more effective when applied to memorization-heavy, keyword-
friendly topics and may not be broadly suitable.5  Keyword mnemonics may 
not produce long-term retention, so consider combining mnemonics with 
distributed, retrieval-based practice (eg, via flash cards with SRS).
Self-made mnemonics may have an advantage when material is simple and 
keyword friendly. If you can create your own mnemonic that accurately 
represents the material, this will be more memorable. When topics are 
complex and accurate mnemonics are challenging to create, pre-made 
mnemonics may be more effective, especially if you are inexperienced at 
creating mnemonics.11
Elaborative Interrogation/Self-Explanation
Elaborative interrogation (“why” questions) and self-explanation (general 
questioning) prompt learners to generate explanations for facts. When 
reading passages of discrete facts, consider using these techniques, which 
have been shown to be more effective than rereading (eg, improved recall 
and better problem-solving/diagnostic performance).5,12,13
Concept Mapping
Concept mapping is a method for graphically organizing knowledge, with 
concepts enclosed in boxes and lines drawn between related concepts. 
Creating or studying concept maps may be more effective than other 
activities (eg, writing or reading summaries/outlines). However, studies have 
reached mixed conclusions about its utility, and the small size of this effect 
raises doubts about its authenticity and pedagogic significance.14
LOW EFFICACY
Rereading
While the most commonly used method among surveyed students, 
rereading has not been shown to correlate with grade point average.9 Due to 
its popularity, rereading is often a comparator in studies on learning. Other 
 ` Elaborative interrogation and self-
explanation prompt learners to generate 
explanations for facts, which improves recall 
and problem solving.
Section i Guide to efficient exam PreParation 
14
strategies that we have discussed (eg, practice testing) have been shown to be 
significantly more effective than rereading.
Highlighting/Underlining
Because this method is passive, it tends to be of minimal value for learning 
and recall. In fact, lower-performing students are more likely to use these 
techniques.9 Students who highlight and underline do not learn how 
to actively recall learned information and thus find it difficult to apply 
knowledge to exam questions.
Summarization
While more useful for improving performance on generative measures (eg, 
free recall or essays), summarization is less useful for exams that depend on 
recognition (eg, multiple choice). Findings on the overall efficacy of this 
method have been mixed.5
 
` TIMELINE FOR STUDY
Before Starting
Your preparation for the USMLE Step 1 should begin when you enter 
medical school. Organize and commit to studying from the beginning so 
that when the time comes to prepare for the USMLE, you will be ready with 
a strong foundation.
Make a Schedule
After you have defined your goals, map out a study schedule that is consistent 
with your objectives, your vacation time, the difficulty of your ongoing 
coursework, and your family and social commitments. Determine whether you 
want to spread out your study time or concentrate it into 14-hour study days in 
the final weeks. Then factor in your own history in preparing for standardized 
examinations (eg, SAT, MCAT). Talk to students at your school who have 
recently taken Step 1. Ask them for their study schedules, especially those who 
have study habits and goals similar to yours. Sample schedules can be found at 
https://firstaidteam.com/schedules/. 
Typically, US medical schools allot between four and eight weeks for 
dedicated Step 1 preparation. The time you dedicate to exam preparation 
will depend on your confidence in comfortably achieving a passing score 
as well as your success in preparing yourself during the first two years of 
medical school. Some students reserve about a week at the end of their 
study period for final review; others save just a few days. When you have 
scheduled your exam date, do your best to adhere to it. 
 ` Customize your schedule. Tackle your weakest 
section first.
Guide to efficient exam PreParation 
Section i
15
Make your schedule realistic, and set achievable goals. Many students make 
the mistake of studying at a level of detail that requires too much time for a 
comprehensive review—reading Gray’s Anatomy in a couple of days is not a 
realistic goal! Have one catch-up day per week of studying. No matter how 
well you stick to your schedule, unexpected events happen. But don’t let 
yourself procrastinate because you have catch-up days; stick to your schedule 
as closely as possible and revise it regularly on the basis of your actual 
progress. Be careful not to lose focus. Beware of feelings of inadequacy when 
comparing study schedules and progress with your peers. Avoid others who 
stress you out. Focus on a few top-rated resources that suit your learning 
style—not on some obscure books your friends may pass down to you. 
Accept the fact that you cannot learn it all.
You will need time for uninterrupted and focused study. Plan your 
personal affairs to minimize crisis situations near the date of the test. Allot 
an adequate number of breaks in your study schedule to avoid burnout. 
Maintain a healthy lifestyle with proper diet, exercise, and sleep.
Another important aspect of your preparation is your studying environment. 
Study where you have always been comfortable studying. Be sure to 
include everything you need close by (review books, notes, coffee, snacks, 
etc). If you’re the kind of person who cannot study alone, form a study group 
with other students taking the exam. The main point here is to create a 
comfortable environment with minimal distractions.
Year(s) Prior
The knowledge you gained during your first two years of medical school and 
even during your undergraduate years should provide the groundwork on 
which to base your test preparation. Student scores on NBME subject tests 
(commonly known as “shelf exams”) have been shown to be highly correlated 
with subsequent Step 1 performance.16 Moreover, undergraduate science 
GPAs as well as MCAT scores are strong predictors of performance on the 
Step 1 exam.17 
We also recommend that you buy highly rated review books early in your first 
year of medical school and use them as you study throughout the two years. 
When Step 1 comes along, these books will be familiar and personalized to the 
way in which you learn. It is risky and intimidating to use unfamiliar review 
books in the final two or three weeks preceding the exam. Some students find 
it helpful to personalize and annotate First Aid throughout the curriculum.
Months Prior
Review test dates and the application procedure. Testing for the USMLE 
Step 1 is done on a year-round basis. If you have disabilities or special 
circumstances, contact the NBME as early as possible to discuss test 
accommodations (see the Section I Supplement at www.firstaidteam.com/
bonus).
 ` Avoid burnout. Maintain proper diet, exercise, 
and sleep habits. 
 ` Buy review resources early (first year) and use 
while studying for courses.
Section i Guide to efficient exam PreParation 
16
Use this time to finalize your ideal schedule. Consider upcoming breaks 
and whether you want to relax or study. Work backward from your test date 
to make sure you finish at least one question bank. Also add time to redo 
missed or flagged questions (which may be half the bank). This is the time to 
build a structured plan with enough flexibility for the realities of life.
Begin doing blocks of questions from reputable question banks under “real” 
conditions. Don’t use tutor mode until you’re sure you can finish blocks 
in the allotted time. It is important to continue balancing success in your 
normal studies with the Step 1 test preparation process.
Weeks Prior (Dedicated Preparation)
Your dedicated prep time may be one week or two months. You should have 
a working plan as you go into this period. Finish your schoolwork strong, take 
a day off, and then get to work. Start by simulating a full-length USMLE 
Step 1 if you haven’t yet done so. Consider doing one NBME CBSSA and 
the free questions from the NBME website. Alternatively, you could choose 7 
blocks of randomized questions from a commercial question bank. Make sure 
you get feedback on your strengths and weaknesses and adjust your studying 
accordingly. Many students study from review sources or comprehensive 
programs for part of the day, then do question blocks. Also, keep in mind that 
reviewing a question block can take upward of two hours. Feedback from 
CBSSA exams and question banks will help you focus on your weaknesses.
One Week Prior
Make sure you have your CIN (found on your scheduling permit) as 
well as other items necessary for the day of the examination, including 
a current driver’s license or another form of photo ID with your signature 
(make sure the name on your ID exactly matches that on your scheduling 
permit). Confirm the Prometric testing center location and test time. Work 
out how you will get to the testing center and what parking, traffic, and 
public transportation problems you might encounter. Exchange cell phone 
numbers with other students taking the test on the same day in case of 
emergencies. Check www.prometric.com/closures for test site closures due 
to unforeseen events. Determine what you will do for lunch. Make sure you 
have everything you need to ensure that you will be comfortable and alert at 
the test site. It may be beneficial to adjust your schedule to start waking up 
at the same time that you will on your test day. And of course, make sure to 
maintain a healthy lifestyle and get enough sleep. 
One Day Prior
Try your best to relax and rest the night before the test. Double-check your 
admissions and test-taking materials as well as the comfort measures discussed 
earlier so that you will not have to deal with such details on the morning of 
the exam. At this point it will be more effective to review short-term memory 
 ` Simulate the USMLE Step 1 under “real” 
conditions before beginning your studies.
 ` In the final two weeks, focus on review, 
practice questions, and endurance. Stay 
confident!
 ` One week before the test:
 � Sleep according to the same schedule you’ll 
use on test day
 � Review the CBT tutorial one last time
 � Call Prometric to confirm test date and time

material that you’re already familiar with than to try to learn new material. 
The Rapid Review section at the end of this book is high yield for last-minute 
studying. Remember that regardless of how hard you have studied, you cannot 
(and need not!) know everything. There will be things on the exam that you have 
never even seen before, so do not panic. Do not underestimate your abilities. 
Many students report difficulty sleeping the night prior to the exam. This is 
often exacerbated by going to bed much earlier than usual. Do whatever it 
takes to ensure a good night’s sleep (eg, massage, exercise, warm milk, no 
screens at night). Do not change your daily routine prior to the exam. Exam 
day is not the day for a caffeine-withdrawal headache.
Morning of the Exam
On the morning of the Step 1 exam, wake up at your regular time and 
eat a normal breakfast. If you think it will help you, have a close friend 
or family member check to make sure you get out of bed. Make sure you 
have your scheduling permit admission ticket, test-taking materials, and 
comfort measures as discussed earlier. Wear loose, comfortable clothing. 
Limiting the number of pockets in your outfit may save time during security 
screening. Plan for a variable temperature in the testing center. Arrive at 
the test site 30 minutes before the time designated on the admission ticket; 
however, do not come too early, as doing so may intensify your anxiety. 
When you arrive at the test site, the proctor should give you a USMLE 
information sheet that will explain critical factors such as the proper use of 
break time. Seating may be assigned, but ask to be reseated if necessary; you 
need to be seated in an area that will allow you to remain comfortable and 
to concentrate. Get to know your testing station, especially if you have never 
been in a Prometric testing center before. Listen to your proctors regarding 
any changes in instructions or testing procedures that may apply to your test 
site.
If you are experiencing symptoms of illness on the day of your exam, we 
strongly recommend you reschedule. If you become ill or show signs of 
illness (eg, persistent cough) during the exam, the test center may prohibit 
you from completing the exam due to health and safety risks for test center 
staff and other examinees.
Finally, remember that it is natural (and even beneficial) to be a little 
nervous. Focus on being mentally clear and alert. Avoid panic. When you 
are asked to begin the exam, take a deep breath, focus on the screen, and 
then begin. Keep an eye on the timer. Take advantage of breaks between 
blocks to stretch, maybe do some jumping jacks, and relax for a moment 
with deep breathing or stretching.
After the Test
After you have completed the exam, be sure to have fun and relax regardless 
of how you may feel. Taking the test is an achievement in itself. Remember, 
 ` No notes, books, calculators, pagers, cell 
phones, recording devices, or watches of any 
kind are allowed in the testing area, but they 
are allowed in lockers and may be accessed 
during authorized breaks.
 ` Arrive at the testing center 30 minutes before 
your scheduled exam time. If you arrive 
more than half an hour late, you will not be 
allowed to take the test.

you are much more likely to have passed than not. Enjoy the free time 
you have before your clerkships. Expect to experience some “reentry” 
phenomena as you try to regain a real life. Once you have recovered 
sufficiently from the test (or from partying), we invite you to send us your 
feedback, corrections, and suggestions for entries, facts, mnemonics, 
strategies, resource ratings, and the like (see p. xvii, How to Contribute). 
Sharing your experience will benefit fellow medical students.
 
` STUDY MATERIALS
Quality Considerations
Although an ever-increasing number of review books and software are now 
available on the market, the quality of such material is highly variable. Some 
common problems are as follows:
 
� Certain review books are too detailed to allow for review in a reasonable 
amount of time or cover subtopics that are not emphasized on the exam.
 
�  Many sample question books were originally written years ago and have 
not been adequately updated to reflect recent trends.
 
� Some question banks test to a level of detail that you will not find on the 
exam.
Review Books
In selecting review books, be sure to weigh different opinions against each 
other, read the reviews and ratings in Section IV of this guide, examine the 
books closely in the bookstore, and choose carefully. You are investing not 
only money but also your limited study time. Do not worry about finding 
the “perfect” book, as many subjects simply do not have one, and different 
students prefer different formats. Supplement your chosen books with personal 
notes from other sources, including what you learn from question banks.
There are two types of review books: those that are stand-alone titles and 
those that are part of a series. Books in a series generally have the same style, 
and you must decide if that style works for you. However, a given style is not 
optimal for every subject.
You should also find out which books are up to date. Some recent editions 
reflect major improvements, whereas others contain only cursory changes. 
Take into consideration how a book reflects the format of the USMLE Step 1. 
Apps
With the explosion of smartphones and tablets, apps are an increasingly 
popular way to review for the Step 1 exam. The majority of apps are 
compatible with both iOS and Android. Many popular Step 1 review 
resources (eg, UWorld, USMLE-Rx) have apps that are compatible with 
 ` If a given review book is not working for you, 
stop using it no matter how highly rated it 
may be or how much it costs.
 ` Charts and diagrams may be the best 
approach for physiology and biochemistry, 
whereas tables and outlines may be 
preferable for microbiology.
Guide to efficient exam PreParation 
Section i
19
their software. Many popular web references (eg, UpToDate) also now offer 
app versions. All of these apps offer flexibility, allowing you to study while 
away from a computer (eg, while traveling).
Practice Tests
Taking practice tests provides valuable information about potential strengths 
and weaknesses in your fund of knowledge and test-taking skills. Some 
students use practice examinations simply as a means of breaking up the 
monotony of studying and adding variety to their study schedule, whereas 
other students rely almost solely on practice. You should also subscribe to 
one or more high-quality question banks. 
Additionally, some students preparing for the Step 1 exam have started to 
incorporate case-based books intended primarily for clinical students on the 
wards or studying for the Step 2 CK exam. First Aid Cases for the USMLE 
Step 1 aims to directly address this need.
After taking a practice test, spend time on each question and each answer 
choice whether you were right or wrong. There are important teaching 
points in each explanation. Knowing why a wrong answer choice is incorrect 
is just as important as knowing why the right answer is correct. Do not panic 
if your practice scores are low as many questions try to trick or distract you to 
highlight a certain point. Use the questions you missed or were unsure about 
to develop focused plans during your scheduled catch-up time.
Textbooks and Course Syllabi
Limit your use of textbooks and course syllabi for Step 1 review. Many 
textbooks are too detailed for high-yield review and include material that 
is generally not tested on the USMLE Step 1 (eg, drug dosages, complex 
chemical structures). Syllabi, although familiar, are inconsistent across 
medical schools and frequently reflect the emphasis of individual faculty, 
which often does not correspond to that of the USMLE Step 1. Syllabi also 
tend to be less organized than top-rated books and generally contain fewer 
diagrams and study questions.
 
` TEST-TAKING STRATEGIES
Your test performance will be influenced by both your knowledge and your 
test-taking skills. You can strengthen your performance by considering each 
of these factors. Test-taking skills and strategies should be developed and 
perfected well in advance of the test date so that you can concentrate on the 
test itself. We suggest that you try the following strategies to see if they might 
work for you.
 ` Most practice exams are shorter and less 
clinical than the real thing.
 ` Use practice tests to identify concepts and 
areas of weakness, not just facts that you

Pacing
You have seven hours to complete up to 280 questions. Note that each one-
hour block contains up to 40 questions. This works out to approximately 
90 seconds per question. We recommend following the “1 minute rule” to pace 
yourself. Spend no more than 1 minute on each question. If you are still unsure 
about the answer after this time, mark the question, make an educated guess, 
and move on. Following this rule, you should have approximately 20 minutes 
left after all questions are answered, which you can use to revisit all of your 
marked questions. Remember that some questions may be experimental 
and do not count for points (and reassure yourself that these experimental 
questions are the ones that are stumping you). In the past, pacing errors have 
been detrimental to the performance of even highly prepared examinees. The 
bottom line is to keep one eye on the clock at all times!
Dealing with Each Question
There are several established techniques for efficiently approaching 
multiple choice questions; find what works for you. One technique begins 
with identifying each question as easy, workable, or impossible. Your goal 
should be to answer all easy questions, resolve all workable questions in a 
reasonable amount of time, and make quick and intelligent guesses on all 
impossible questions. Most students read the stem, think of the answer, and 
turn immediately to the choices. A second technique is to first skim the 
answer choices to get a context, then read the last sentence of the question 
(the lead-in), and then read through the passage quickly, extracting only 
information relevant to answering the question. This can be particularly 
helpful for questions with long clinical vignettes. Try a variety of techniques 
on practice exams and see what works best for you. If you get overwhelmed, 
remember that a 30-second time out to refocus may get you back on track.
Guessing
There is no penalty for wrong answers. Thus no test block should be left 
with unanswered questions. If you don’t know the answer, first eliminate 
incorrect choices, then guess among the remaining options. Note that 
dozens of questions are unscored experimental questions meant to obtain 
statistics for future exams. Therefore, some questions may seem unusual 
or unreasonably difficult simply because they are part of the development 
process for future exams.
Changing Your Answer
The conventional wisdom is not to second-guess your initial answers. 
However, studies have consistently shown that test takers are more likely 
to change from a wrong answer to the correct answer than the other way 
around. Many question banks tell you how many questions you changed 
from right to wrong, wrong to wrong, and wrong to right. Use this feedback 
 ` Time management is an important skill for 
exam success.

to judge how good a second-guesser you are. If you have extra time, reread 
the question stem and make sure you didn’t misinterpret the question.
 
` CLINICAL VIGNETTE STRATEGIES
In recent years, the USMLE Step 1 has become increasingly clinically 
oriented. This change mirrors the trend in medical education toward 
introducing students to clinical problem solving during the basic science 
years. The increasing clinical emphasis on Step 1 may be challenging to 
those students who attend schools with a more traditional curriculum.
What Is a Clinical Vignette?
A clinical vignette is a short (usually paragraph-long) description of a patient, 
including demographics, presenting symptoms, signs, and other information 
concerning the patient. Sometimes this paragraph is followed by a brief 
listing of important physical findings and/or laboratory results. The task of 
assimilating all this information and answering the associated question in the 
span of one minute can be intimidating. So be prepared to read quickly and 
think on your feet. Remember that the question is often indirectly asking 
something you already know.
A pseudovignette is a question that includes a description of a case similar to 
that of a clinical vignette, but it ends with a declarative recall question; thus 
the material presented in the pseudovignette is not necessary to answer the 
question. Question writers strive to avoid pseudovignettes on the USMLE 
Step 1. Be prepared to tackle each vignette as if the information presented is 
important to answer the associated question correctly.
Strategy
Remember that Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or disorders in 
their most classic presentation. So look for cardinal signs (eg, malar rash for 
lupus or nuchal rigidity for meningitis) in the narrative history. Be aware that 
the question will contain classic signs and symptoms instead of buzzwords. 
Sometimes the data from labs and the physical exam will help you confirm 
or reject possible diagnoses, thereby helping you rule answer choices in or 
out. In some cases, they will be a dead giveaway for the diagnosis.
Making a diagnosis from the history and data is often not the final answer. Not 
infrequently, the diagnosis is divulged at the end of the vignette, after you have 
just struggled through the narrative to come up with a diagnosis of your own. 
The question might then ask about a related aspect of the diagnosed disease. 
Consider skimming the answer choices and lead-in before diving into a long 
stem. However, be careful with skimming the answer choices; going too fast 
may warp your perception of what the vignette is asking.
 ` Go with your first hunch, unless you are 
certain that you are a good second-guesser.
 ` Be prepared to read fast and think on your 
feet!
 ` Practice questions that include case histories 
or descriptive vignettes are critical for Step 1 
preparation.
 ` Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or 
disorders in their most classic presentation.

` IF YOU THINK YOU FAILED
After taking the test, it is normal for many examinees to feel unsure about 
their performance, despite the majority of them achieving a passing score. 
Historical pass data is in Table 2. If you remain quite concerned, it may 
be wise to prepare a course of action should you need to retest. There are 
several sensible steps you can take to plan for the future in the event that 
you do not achieve a passing score. First, save and organize all your study 
materials, including review books, practice tests, and notes. Familiarize 
yourself with the reapplication procedures for Step 1, including application 
deadlines and upcoming test dates. 
Make sure you know both your school’s and the NBME’s policies regarding 
retakes. The total number of attempts an examinee may take per Step 
examination is four.18 You make take Step 1 no more than three times within 
a 12-month period. Your fourth attempt must be at least 12 months after 
your first attempt at that exam, and at least 6 months after your most recent 
attempt at that exam. 
If you failed, the performance profiles on the back of the USMLE Step 1 
score report provide valuable feedback concerning your relative strengths 
and weaknesses. Study these profiles closely. Set up a study timeline to 
strengthen gaps in your knowledge as well as to maintain and improve what 
you already know. Do not neglect high-yield subjects. It is normal to feel 
somewhat anxious about retaking the test, but if anxiety becomes a problem, 
seek appropriate counseling.

` HOW TO USE THE DATABASE
The 2023 edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 contains a revised and 
expanded database of basic science material that students, student authors, 
and faculty authors have identified as high yield for board review. The 
information is presented in a partially organ-based format. Hence, Section 
II is devoted to the foundational principles of biochemistry, microbiology, 
immunology, basic pathology, basic pharmacology, and public health 
sciences. Section III focuses on organ systems, with subsections covering 
the embryology, anatomy and histology, physiology, clinical pathology, and 
clinical pharmacology relevant to each. Each subsection is then divided 
into smaller topic areas containing related facts. Individual facts are 
generally presented in a three-column format, with the Title of the fact in 
the first column, the Description of the fact in the second column, and the 
Mnemonic or Special Note in the third column. Some facts do not have a 
mnemonic and are presented in a two-column format. Others are presented 
in list or tabular form in order to emphasize key associations. 
The database structure used in Sections II and III is useful for reviewing 
material already learned. These sections are not ideal for learning complex 
or highly conceptual material for the first time.
The database of high-yield facts is not comprehensive. Use it to complement 
your core study mate rial and not as your primary study source. The facts and 
notes have been condensed and edited to emphasize the high-yield material, 
and as a result, each entry is “incomplete” and arguably “over-simplified.” 
Often, the more you research a topic, the more complex it becomes, with 
certain topics resisting simplification. Determine your most efficient 
methods for learning the material, and do not be afraid to abandon a strategy 
if it is not working for you.
Our database of high-yield facts is updated annually to keep current with 
new trends in boards emphasis, including clinical relevance. However, we 
must note that inevitably many other high-yield topics are not yet included 
in our database.
We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit high-yield 
topics, well-written entries, diagrams, clinical images, and useful mnemonics 
so that we may enhance the database for future students. We also solicit 
recommendations of alternate tools for study that may be useful in preparing 
for the examination, such as charts, flash cards, apps, and online resources 
(see How to Contribute, p. xv).

This high-yield material includes molecular biology, genetics, cell 
biology, and principles of metabolism (especially vitamins, cofactors, 
minerals, and single-enzyme-deficiency diseases). When studying 
metabolic pathways, emphasize important regulatory steps and enzyme 
deficiencies that result in disease, as well as reactions targeted by 
pharmacologic interventions. For example, understanding the defect 
in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its clinical consequences is higher yield 
than memorizing every intermediate in the purine salvage pathway.
Do not spend time learning details of organic chemistry, mechanisms, or 
physical chemistry. Detailed chemical structures are infrequently tested; 
however, many structures have been included here to help students 
learn reactions and the important enzymes involved. Familiarity with 
the biochemical techniques that have medical relevance—such as 
ELISA, immunoelectrophoresis, Southern blotting, and PCR—is 
useful. Review the related biochemistry when studying pharmacology or 
genetic diseases as a way to reinforce and integrate the material.

Chromatin structure
DNA exists in the condensed, chromatin form to 
fit into the nucleus. DNA loops twice around a 
histone octamer to form a nucleosome (“beads 
on a string”). H1 binds to the nucleosome 
and to “linker DNA,” thereby stabilizing the 
chromatin fiber.
DNA has ⊝ charge from phosphate groups. 
Histones are large and have ⊕ charge from 
lysine and arginine.
In mitosis, DNA condenses to form 
chromosomes. DNA and histone synthesis 
occurs during S phase.
Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is 
circular and does not utilize histones.

Barr bodies (inactive X chromosomes) may be

Euchromatin
Less condensed, appears lighter on EM (labeled

Eu = true, “truly transcribed.”
Euchromatin is expressed.
DNA methylation
Changes the expression of a DNA segment 
without changing the sequence. Involved with 
aging, carcinogenesis, genomic imprinting, 
transposable element repression, and X 
chromosome inactivation (lyonization).
DNA is methylated in imprinting.
Methylation within gene promoter (CpG islands) 
typically represses (silences) gene transcription.
CpG methylation makes DNA mute.
Dysregulated DNA methylation is implicated in 
Fragile X syndrome.
Histone methylation 
Usually causes reversible transcriptional 
suppression, but can also cause activation 
depending on location of methyl groups.
Histone methylation mostly makes DNA mute.
Lysine and arginine residues of histones can be 
methylated.
Histone acetylation
Removal of histone’s ⊕ charge � relaxed DNA 
coiling � � transcription.
Thyroid hormone synthesis is altered by 
acetylation of thyroid hormone receptor.
Histone acetylation makes DNA active.
Histone deacetylation
Removal of acetyl groups � tightened DNA 
coiling � � transcription.
Histone deacetylation may be responsible for

(topoisomerase II) stranded break in the helix 
to add or remove supercoils (as needed due to 
underwinding or overwinding of DNA).
In eukaryotes: irinotecan/topotecan inhibit 
topoisomerase (TOP) I, etoposide/teniposide 
inhibit TOP II.
In prokaryotes: fluoroquinolones inhibit TOP II 
(DNA gyrase) and TOP IV.
Primase  F
Makes RNA primer for DNA polymerase III to 
initiate replication.
DNA polymerase III  G 
Prokaryotes only. Elongates leading strand 
by adding deoxynucleotides to the 3′ end. 
Elongates lagging strand until it reaches 
primer of preceding fragment.
DNA polymerase III has 5′ � 3′ synthesis and 
proofreads with 3′ � 5′ exonuclease.
Drugs blocking DNA replication often have a 
modified 3′ OH, thereby preventing addition of 
the next nucleotide (“chain termination”).
DNA polymerase I  H 
Prokaryotes only. Degrades RNA primer; 
replaces it with DNA.
Same functions as DNA polymerase III, also 
excises RNA primer with 5′ � 3′ exonuclease.
DNA ligase  I
Catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester 
bond within a strand of double-stranded DNA.
Joins Okazaki fragments. 
Ligase links DNA.
Telomerase
Eukaryotes only. A reverse transcriptase (RNA-
dependent DNA polymerase) that adds DNA 
(TTAGGG) to 3′ ends of chromosomes to avoid 
loss of genetic material with every duplication. 
Upregulated in progenitor cells and also often in 
cancer; downregulated in aging and progeria.
Telomerase TAGs for Greatness and Glory.

Base-specific Glycosylase removes altered base 
and creates AP site (apurinic/apyrimidinic). 
One or more nucleotides are removed by 
AP-Endonuclease, which cleaves 5′ end. AP-

Mutations in DNA
Degree of change: silent << missense < nonsense < frameshift. Single nucleotide substitutions are 
repaired by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. Types of single nucleotide (point) mutations:
 � Transition—purine to purine (eg, A to G) or pyrimidine to pyrimidine (eg, C to T).
 � Transversion—purine to pyrimidine (eg, A to T) or pyrimidine to purine (eg, C to G).
Single nucleotide substitutions
Silent mutation
Codes for same (synonymous) amino acid; often involves 3rd position of codon (tRNA wobble).
Missense mutation
Results in changed amino acid (called conservative if new amino acid has similar chemical 
structure). Examples: sickle cell disease (substitution of glutamic acid with valine).
Nonsense mutation
Results in early stop codon (UGA, UAA, UAG). Usually generates nonfunctional protein. Stop the 
nonsense!
Other mutations
Frameshift mutation
Deletion or insertion of any number of nucleotides not divisible by 3 � misreading of all 
nucleotides downstream. Protein may be shorter or longer, and its function may be disrupted or 
altered. Examples: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis.
Splice site mutation
Retained intron in mRNA � protein with impaired or altered function. Examples: rare causes of 
cancers, dementia, epilepsy, some types of β-thalassemia, Gaucher disease, Marfan syndrome.

Lac operon
Classic example of a genetic response to an environmental change. Glucose is the preferred 
metabolic substrate in E coli, but when glucose is absent and lactose is available, the lac operon is 
activated to switch to lactose metabolism. Mechanism of shift:
 � Low glucose � � adenylate cyclase activity � � generation of cAMP from ATP � activation of 
catabolite activator protein (CAP) � � transcription.
 � High lactose � unbinds repressor protein from repressor/operator site � � transcription.

Regulation of gene expression
Promoter
Site where RNA polymerase II and multiple 
other transcription factors bind to DNA 
upstream from gene locus (AT-rich upstream 
sequence with TATA and CAAT boxes, which 
differ between eukaryotes and prokaryotes). 
Promoters increase ori activity.
Promoter mutation commonly results in 
dramatic � in level of gene transcription.
Enhancer
DNA locus where regulatory proteins 
(“activators”) bind, increasing expression of a 
gene on the same chromosome.
Enhancers and silencers may be located close to, 
far from, or even within (in an intron) the gene 
whose expression they regulate.
Silencer
DNA locus where regulatory proteins 
(“repressors”) bind, decreasing expression of a 
gene on the same chromosome.
Epigenetics
Changes made to gene expression (heritable 
mitotically/meiotically) without a change in 
underlying DNA sequence. 
Primary mechanisms of epigenetic change 
include DNA methylation, histone 
modification, and noncoding RNA.

RNA processing 
(eukaryotes)
Initial transcript is called heterogeneous nuclear 
RNA (hnRNA). hnRNA is then modified and 
becomes mRNA.
Poly-A polymerase does not require a template.
AAUAAA = polyadenylation signal. Mutation 
in polyadenylation signal � early degradation 
prior to translation.
Kozak sequence—initiation site in most 
eukaryotic mRNA. Facilitates binding of small 
subunit of ribosome to mRNA. Mutations 
in sequence � impairment of initiation of 
translation � � protein synthesis.
 
The following processes occur in the nucleus:
 � Capping of 5′ end (addition of 
7-methylguanosine cap; cotranscriptional)
 � Polyadenylation of 3′ end (∼200 A’s � poly-A 
tail; posttranscriptional)
 � Splicing out of introns (posttranscriptional)
Capped, tailed, and spliced transcript is called 
mRNA.
mRNA is transported out of nucleus to be 
translated in cytosol.
mRNA quality control occurs at cytoplasmic 
processing bodies (P-bodies), which contain 
exonucleases, decapping enzymes, and 
microRNAs; mRNAs may be degraded or 
stored in P-bodies for future translation.
RNA polymerases
Eukaryotes
RNA polymerase I makes rRNA, the most 
common (rampant) type; present only in 
nucleolus.
RNA polymerase II makes mRNA (massive), 
microRNA (miRNA), and small nuclear RNA 
(snRNA).
RNA polymerase III makes 5S rRNA, tRNA 
(tiny).
No proofreading function, but can initiate 
chains. RNA polymerase II opens DNA at 
promoter site. 
I, II, and III are numbered in the same order 
that their products are used in protein 
synthesis: rRNA, mRNA, then tRNA.
α-amanitin, found in Amanita phalloides (death 
cap mushrooms), inhibits RNA polymerase II. 
Causes dysentery and severe hepatotoxicity if 
ingested.
Dactinomycin inhibits RNA polymerase in both 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Prokaryotes
1 RNA polymerase (multisubunit complex) 
makes all 3 kinds of RNA.
Rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin) inhibit DNA-
dependent RNA polymerase in prokaryotes.

Introns vs exons
Exons contain the actual genetic information 
coding for protein or functional RNA.
Introns do not code for protein, but are 
important in regulation of gene expression.
Different exons are frequently combined by 
alternative splicing to produce a larger number 
of unique proteins.
Introns are intervening sequences and stay 
in the nucleus, whereas exons exit and are 
expressed.
Alternative splicing—can produce a variety 
of protein products from a single hnRNA 
(heterogenous nuclear RNA) sequence (eg, 
transmembrane vs secreted Ig, tropomyosin 
variants in muscle, dopamine receptors in the 
brain, host defense evasion by tumor cells).

Splicing of pre-mRNA
Part of process by which precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is transformed into mature mRNA. Introns 
typically begin with GU and end with AG. Alterations in snRNP assembly can cause clinical 
disease; eg, in spinal muscular atrophy, snRNP assembly is affected due to � SMN protein 
� congenital degeneration of anterior horns of spinal cord � symmetric weakness (hypotonia, or 
“floppy baby syndrome”).
snRNPs are snRNA bound to proteins (eg, Smith [Sm]) to form a spliceosome that cleaves pre-
mRNA. Anti-U1 snRNP antibodies are associated with SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, 
other rheumatic diseases.

tRNA 
Structure
75–90 nucleotides, 2º structure, cloverleaf form, anticodon end is opposite 3′ aminoacyl end. All 
tRNAs, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, have CCA at 3′ end along with a high percentage of 
chemically modified bases. The amino acid is covalently bound to the 3′ end of the tRNA. CCA 
Can Carry Amino acids.
T-arm: contains the TΨC (ribothymidine, pseudouridine, cytidine) sequence necessary for tRNA-
ribosome binding. T-arm Tethers tRNA molecule to ribosome. 
D-arm: contains Dihydrouridine residues necessary for tRNA recognition by the correct aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetase. D-arm allows Detection of the tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. 
Attachment site: 3′-ACC-5′ is the amino acid ACCeptor site.
Charging
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (uses ATP; 1 unique enzyme per respective amino acid) and 
binding of charged tRNA to the codon are responsible for the accuracy of amino acid selection. 
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase matches an amino acid to the tRNA by scrutinizing the amino acid 
before and after it binds to tRNA. If an incorrect amino acid is attached, the bond is hydrolyzed. 
A mischarged tRNA reads the usual codon but inserts the wrong amino acid.

Protein synthesis
Initiation
1. Eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) identify 
the 5′ cap.
2. eIFs help assemble the 40S ribosomal 
subunit with the initiator tRNA.
3. eIFs released when the mRNA and the 
ribosomal 60S subunit assemble with the 
complex. Requires GTP.
Eukaryotes: 40S + 60S � 80S (even).
Prokaryotes: 30S + 50S � 70S (prime).
Synthesis occurs from N-terminus to 
C-terminus.
ATP—tRNA Activation (charging).
GTP—tRNA Gripping and Going places 
(translocation).
Think of “going APE”:
A site = incoming Aminoacyl-tRNA.
P site = accommodates growing Peptide.
E site = holds Empty tRNA as it Exits.
Elongation factors are targets of bacterial toxins 
(eg, Diphtheria, Pseudomonas).
Shine-Dalgarno sequence—ribosomal binding 
site in prokaryotic mRNA. Recognized by 16S 
RNA in ribosomal subunit. Enables protein 
synthesis initiation by aligning ribosome with 
start codon so that code is read correctly.
Elongation
  Aminoacyl-tRNA binds to A site (except for 
initiator methionine, which binds the P site), 
requires an elongation factor and GTP.
  rRNA (“ribozyme”) catalyzes peptide bond 
formation, transfers growing polypeptide to 
amino acid in A site.
 Ribosome advances 3 nucleotides toward 3′ 
end of mRNA, moving peptidyl tRNA to P 
site (translocation).
Termination
Eukaryotic release factors (eRFs) recognize the 
stop codon and halt translation � completed 
polypeptide is released from ribosome. 
Requires GTP.

Cell cycle phases 
Checkpoints control transitions between phases of cell cycle. This process is regulated by cyclins, 
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and tumor suppressors. M phase (shortest phase of cell cycle) 
includes mitosis (prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) and cytokinesis 
(cytoplasm splits in two). G1 is of variable duration.
REGUlATION OF CEll CYClE
Cyclin-dependent 
kinases
Constitutively expressed but inactive when not bound to cyclin.
Cyclin-CDK complexes
Cyclins are phase-specific regulatory proteins that activate CDKs when stimulated by growth 
factors. The cyclin-CDK complex can then phosphorylate other proteins (eg, Rb) to coordinate 
cell cycle progression. This complex must be activated/inactivated at appropriate times for cell 
cycle to progress.
Tumor suppressors
p53 � p21 induction � CDK inhibition � Rb hypophosphorylation (activation) � G1-S 
progression inhibition. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes can result in unrestrained cell 
division (eg, Li-Fraumeni syndrome).
Growth factors (eg, insulin, PDGF, EPO, EGF) bind tyrosine kinase receptors to transition the cell 
from G1 to S phase.
CEll TYPES
Permanent
Remain in G0, regenerate from stem cells.
Neurons, skeletal and cardiac muscle, RBCs.

Posttranslational events in GOlgi  include modifying N-oligosaccharides on asparagine, adding 
O-oligosaccharides on serine and threonine, and adding mannose-6-phosphate to proteins for 
lysosomal and other proteins.
Endosomes are sorting centers for material from outside the cell or from the Golgi, sending it to

Membrane-enclosed organelle involved in:
 � β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) (strictly peroxisomal process)
 � α-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids (strictly peroxisomal process)
 � Catabolism of amino acids and ethanol
 � Synthesis of bile acids and plasmalogens (important membrane phospholipid, especially in 
white matter of brain)
Zellweger syndrome—autosomal recessive disorder of peroxisome biogenesis due to mutated PEX 
genes. Hypotonia, seizures, jaundice, craniofacial dysmorphia, hepatomegaly, early death.
Refsum disease—autosomal recessive disorder of α-oxidation � buildup of phytanic acid due 
to inability to degrade it. Scaly skin, ataxia, cataracts/night blindness, shortening of 4th toe, 
epiphyseal dysplasia. Treatment: diet, plasmapheresis.
Adrenoleukodystrophy—X-linked recessive disorder of β-oxidation due to mutation in ABCD1 
gene � VLCFA buildup in adrenal glands, white (leuko) matter of brain, testes. Progressive 
disease that can lead to adrenal gland crisis, progressive loss of neurologic function, death.
Proteasome
Barrel-shaped protein complex that degrades polyubiquitin-tagged proteins. Plays a role in many 
cellular processes, including immune response (MHC I–mediated). Defects in ubiquitin-proteasome

  Hydroxylation—hydroxylation 
(“hydroxCylation”) of specific proline 
and lysine residues. Requires vitamin C; 
deficiency � scurvy.
  Glycosylation—glycosylation of pro-α-chain 
hydroxylysine residues and formation of

Cells are tagged with antibodies specific to 
surface or intracellular proteins. Antibodies 
are then tagged with a unique fluorescent 
dye. Sample is analyzed one cell at a time by 
focusing a laser on the cell and measuring 
light scatter and intensity of fluorescence. 
Data are plotted either as histogram (one 
measure) or scatter plot (any two measures, as 
shown). In illustration: 
 � Cells in left lower quadrant ⊝ for both CD8 
and CD3. 
 � Cells in right lower quadrant ⊕ for CD8

RNA interference
Process whereby small non-coding RNA molecules target mRNAs to inhibit gene expression.
MicroRNA
Naturally produced by cell as hairpin structures. 
Loose nucleotide pairing allows broad

mRNA from a tumor suppressor gene).
Small interfering 
RNA
Usually derived from exogenous dsRNA source 
(eg, virus). Once inside a cell, siRNA requires 
complete nucleotide pairing, leading to highly

equilibrium, then the values of p and q remain 
constant from generation to generation.
In rare autosomal recessive diseases, p ≈ 1.
Example: The prevalence of cystic fibrosis 
(an autosomal recessive disease) in the US 
is approximately 1/3200, which tells us that 
q2 = 1/3200, with q ≈ 0.017 or 1.7% of the 
population. Since p + q = 1, we know that 
p = 1 – √1/3200 ≈ 0.982, which gives us a 
heterozygous carrier frequency of 2pq = 0.035 
or 3.5% of the population. Notice that since 
the disease is relatively rare, we could have 
approximated p ≈ 1 and obtained a similar 
result.
Disorders of imprinting
One gene copy is silenced by methylation, and only the other copy is expressed � parent-of-origin 
effects. The expressed copy may be mutated, may not be expressed, or may be deleted altogether.

Cystic fibrosis
 
GENETICS
Autosomal recessive; defect in CFTR gene on chromosome 7 (deletion; ΔF508). Most common 
lethal genetic disease in patients with European ancestry.
PATHOPHYSIOlOGY
CFTR encodes an ATP-gated Cl− channel (secretes Cl− in lungs/GI tract, reabsorbs Cl− in sweat 
glands). Phe508 deletion � misfolded protein � improper protein trafficking � protein absent 
from cell membrane � � Cl− (and H2O) secretion � compensatory � Na+ reabsorption via 
epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) � � H2O reabsorption � abnormally thick mucus secreted into 
lungs/GI tract. � Na+ reabsorption = more negative transepithelial potential difference.
DIAGNOSIS
� Cl− concentration in pilocarpine-induced sweat test. Can present with contraction alkalosis 
and hypokalemia (ECF effects analogous loop diuretic effect) due to ECF H2O/Na+ losses 
via sweating and concomitant renal K+/H+ wasting. � immunoreactive trypsinogen (newborn 
screening) due to clogging of pancreatic duct.
COMPlICATIONS
Recurrent pulmonary infections (eg, S aureus [infancy and early childhood], P aeruginosa 
[adulthood], allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA]), chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis 
� reticulonodular pattern on CXR, opacification of sinuses. Nasal polyps, nail clubbing. 
Pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption with steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, 
E, K) progressing to endocrine dysfunction (CF-related diabetes), biliary cirrhosis, liver disease. 
Meconium ileus in newborns. 
Infertility in males (absence of vas deferens, spermatogenesis may be unaffected) and subfertility in 
females (amenorrhea, abnormally thick cervical mucus).
TREATMENT
Multifactorial: chest physiotherapy, aerosolized dornase alfa (DNase), and inhaled hypertonic saline 
� mucus clearance. Azithromycin prevents acute exacerbations. Ibuprofen for anti-inflammatory 
effect. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (pancrelipase) for pancreatic insufficiency. 
CFTR modulators can be used alone or in combination. Efficacy varies by different genetic 
mutations (pharmacogenomics). Are either potentiators (hold gate of CFTR channel open � Cl− 
flows through cell membrane; eg, ivacaftor) or correctors (help CFTR protein to form right 3-D 
shape � moves to the cell surface; eg, lumacaftor, tezacaftor).

X-linked recessive 
diseases
Bruton agammaglobulinemia, Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, Fabry disease, G6PD 
deficiency, hemophilia A and B, Hunter syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, ocular albinism, 
ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
Females with Turner syndrome (45,XO) are more likely to have an X-linked recessive disorder.
X-inactivation (lyonization)—during development, one of the X chromosomes in each XX cell 
is randomly deactivated and condensed into a Barr body (methylated heterochromatin). If 
skewed inactivation occurs, XX individuals may express X-linked recessive diseases (eg, G6PD); 
penetrance and severity of X-linked dominant diseases in XX individuals may also be impacted.
Muscular dystrophies
Duchenne 
A
Muscle fibers
X-linked recessive disorder typically due to 
frameshift deletions or nonsense mutations 
� truncated or absent dystrophin protein 
� progressive myofiber damage. Can also 
result from splicing errors. 
Weakness begins in pelvic girdle muscles and 
progresses superiorly. Pseudohypertrophy of 
calf muscles due to fibrofatty replacement of 
muscle A . Waddling gait. 
Onset before 5 years of age. Dilated 
cardiomyopathy is common cause of death.
Gowers sign—patient uses upper extremities to 
help stand up. Classically seen in Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy, but also seen in other 
muscular dystrophies and inflammatory 
myopathies (eg, polymyositis).
Duchenne = deleted dystrophin.
Dystrophin gene (DMD) is the largest 
protein-coding human gene � � chance of 
spontaneous mutation. Dystrophin helps 
to anchor muscle fibers to the extracellular 
matrix, primarily in skeletal and cardiac 
muscles. Loss of dystrophin � myonecrosis.

Less severe than Duchenne (Becker is better). 
Onset in adolescence or early adulthood.
Deletions can cause both Duchenne and 
Becker muscular dystrophies. 2⁄3 of cases have 
large deletions spanning one or more exons.
Myotonic dystrophy
Autosomal dominant. Onset 20–30 years. CTG 
trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DMPK 
gene � abnormal expression of myotonin 
protein kinase � myotonia (eg, difficulty 
releasing hand from handshake), muscle

are preferentially affected (eg, CNS, skeletal muscle).
Mitochondrial myopathies—include MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic 
acidosis and strokelike episodes) and MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers). Light 
microscopy with stain: ragged red fibers due to compensatory proliferation of mitochondria. 
Electron microscopy: mitochondrial crystalline inclusions.
Leber hereditary optic neuropathy—mutations in complex I of ETC � neuronal death in retina 
and optic nerve � subacute bilateral vision loss in teens/young adults (males > females). Usually 
permanent. May be accompanied by neurologic dysfunction (eg, tremors, multiple sclerosis–like 
illness).
Rett syndrome
Sporadic disorder caused by de novo mutation of MECP2 on X chromosome. Seen mostly in 
females. Embryonically lethal in males. Individuals with Rett syndrome experience initial normal 
development (6–18 months) followed by regression (“retturn”) in motor, verbal, and cognitive 
abilities; ataxia; seizures; scoliosis; and stereotypic hand-wringing.
Fragile X syndrome
X-linked dominant inheritance. Trinucleotide 
repeats in FMR1 � hypermethylation of 
cytosine residues � � expression.
Most common inherited cause of intellectual 
disability (Down syndrome is most common 
genetic cause, but most cases occur 
sporadically). 
Trinucleotide repeat expansion [(CGG)n] occurs 
during oogenesis. 
Premutation (50–200 repeats) � tremor, ataxia, 
1° ovarian insufficiency.
Full mutation (>200 repeats) � postpubertal 
macroorchidism (enlarged testes), long face 
with large jaw, large everted ears, autism, 
mitral valve prolapse, hypermobile joints.
Self-mutilation is common and can be confused 
with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

Chromosomal translocation that commonly involves chromosome pairs 21, 22, 13, 14, and 15. 
One of the most common types of translocation. Occurs when the long arms of 2 acrocentric 
chromosomes (chromosomes with centromeres near their ends) fuse at the centromere and the 
2 short arms are lost. 
Balanced translocations (no gain or loss of significant genetic material) normally do not cause 
abnormal phenotype. Unbalanced translocations (missing or extra genes) can result in

` BIOCHEMISTRY—NUTRITION
Essential fatty acids
Polyunsaturated fatty acids that cannot be 
synthesized in the body and must be provided 
in the diet (eg, nuts/seeds, plant oils, seafood).
Linoleic acid (omega-6) is metabolized to 
arachidonic acid, which serves as the precursor 
to leukotrienes and prostaglandins.
Linolenic acid (omega-3) and its metabolites 
have cardioprotective and antihyperlipidemic 
effects.
In contrast, consumption of trans-unsaturated 
fatty acids (found in fast food) promotes 
cardiovascular disease by � LDL and � HDL.
Vitamins: fat soluble
A, D, E, K. Absorption dependent on bile 
emulsification, pancreatic secretions, and 
intact ileum. Toxicity more common than 
for water-soluble vitamins because fat-soluble 
vitamins accumulate in fat.
Malabsorption syndromes with steatorrhea (eg, 
cystic fibrosis and celiac disease) or mineral 
oil intake can cause fat-soluble vitamin 
deficiencies.
Vitamins: water

Vitamin A
Includes retinal, retinol, retinoic acid. 
FUNCTION
Antioxidant; constituent of visual pigments 
(retinal); essential for normal differentiation 
of epithelial cells into specialized tissue 
(pancreatic cells, mucus-secreting cells); 
prevents squamous metaplasia. 
Retinol is vitamin A, so think retin-A (used 
topically for wrinkles and Acne).
Found in liver and leafy vegetables.
Supplementation in vitamin A-deficient measles 
patients may improve outcomes.
Use oral isotretinoin to treat severe cystic acne. 
Use all-trans retinoic acid to treat acute 
promyelocytic leukemia.
DEFICIENCY 
A
Night blindness (nyctalopia); dry, scaly skin 
(xerosis cutis); dry eyes (xerophthalmia); 
conjunctival squamous metaplasia � Bitot 
spots (keratin debris; foamy appearance 
on conjunctiva A ); corneal degeneration 
(keratomalacia); immunosuppression.
EXCESS
Acute toxicity—nausea, vomiting, � ICP (eg, 
vertigo, blurred vision).
Chronic toxicity—alopecia, dry skin (eg, 
scaliness), hepatic toxicity and enlargement, 
arthralgias, and idiopathic intracranial 
hypertension.
Teratogenic (interferes with homeobox gene; cleft 
palate, cardiac abnormalities), therefore a ⊝ 
pregnancy test and two forms of contraception 
are required before isotretinoin (vitamin A 
derivative) is prescribed. 
Isotretinoin is teratogenic.
Vitamin B1
Also called thiamine.
FUNCTION

 � Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase
 � α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (TCA cycle)
 � Pyruvate dehydrogenase (links glycolysis to TCA cycle)
 � Transketolase (HMP shunt)
DEFICIENCY
Impaired glucose breakdown � ATP depletion worsened by glucose infusion; highly aerobic tissues 
(eg, brain, heart) are affected first. In patients with chronic alcohol overuse or malnutrition, give 
thiamine before dextrose to � risk of precipitating Wernicke encephalopathy. 
Diagnosis made by � in RBC transketolase activity following vitamin B1 administration.

Vitamin B2
Also called riboflavin.
FUNCTION
Component of flavins FAD and FMN, used as 
cofactors in redox reactions, eg, the succinate

FAD and FMN are derived from riboFlavin 
(B2 ≈ 2 ATP).
DEFICIENCY
Cheilosis (inflammation of lips, scaling 
and fissures at the corners of the mouth), 
“magenta” tongue, corneal vascularization.
The 2 C’s of B2.
Vitamin B3
Also called niacin, nicotinic acid.
FUNCTION
Constituent of NAD+, NADP+ (used in redox 
reactions and as cofactor by dehydrogenases). 
Derived from tryptophan. Synthesis requires 
vitamins B2 and B6. Used to treat dyslipidemia 
(� VLDL, � HDL).
NAD derived from Niacin (B3 ≈ 3 ATP).
DEFICIENCY
A
Glossitis. Severe deficiency of B3 leads to 
pellagra, which can also be caused by Hartnup 
disease, malignant carcinoid syndrome 
(� tryptophan metabolism � � serotonin 
synthesis), and isoniazid (� vitamin B6). 
Symptoms of B3 deficiency (pellagra) (the 3 
D’s): diarrhea, dementia (also hallucinations), 
dermatitis (C3/C4 dermatome circumferential 
“broad collar” rash [Casal necklace], 
hyperpigmentation of sun-exposed limbs A ).
Hartnup disease—autosomal recessive. 
Deficiency of neutral amino acid (eg, 
tryptophan) transporters in proximal renal 
tubular cells and on enterocytes � neutral 
aminoaciduria and � absorption from the 
gut � � tryptophan for conversion to niacin 
� pellagra-like symptoms. Treat with high-
protein diet and nicotinic acid.
Pellagra = vitamin B3 levels fell.
EXCESS
Facial flushing (induced by prostaglandin, not 
histamine; can avoid by taking aspirin before 
niacin), hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia.
Podagra = vitamin B3 OD (overdose).
Vitamin B5
Also called pantothenic acid. B5 is “pento”thenic acid.
FUNCTION
Component of coenzyme A (CoA, a cofactor for acyl transfers) and fatty acid synthase.
DEFICIENCY
Dermatitis, enteritis, alopecia, adrenal insufficiency may lead to burning sensation of feet 
(“burning feet syndrome”; distal paresthesias, dysesthesia).

ingestion of raw egg whites.
“Avidin in egg whites avidly binds biotin.”
Vitamin B9
Also called folate.
FUNCTION
Converted to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF), a 
coenzyme for 1-carbon transfer/methylation 
reactions.
Important for the synthesis of nitrogenous bases 
in DNA and RNA.
Found in leafy green vegetables. Also produced 
by gut microbiota. Folate absorbed in jejunum 
(think foliage in the “jejun”gle).
Small reserve pool stored primarily in the liver. 
DEFICIENCY
Macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia; 
hypersegmented polymorphonuclear cells 
(PMNs); glossitis; no neurologic symptoms (as 
opposed to vitamin B12 deficiency).
Labs: � homocysteine, normal methylmalonic 
acid levels. Seen in chronic alcohol overuse 
and in pregnancy.
Deficiency can be caused by several drugs (eg, 
phenytoin, trimethoprim, methotrexate).
Supplemental folic acid at least 1 month prior 
to conception and during pregnancy to � risk 
of neural tube defects. Give vitamin B9 for the 
9 months of pregnancy, and 1 month prior to 
conception.

Vitamin B12
Also called cobalamin.
FUNCTION
Cofactor for methionine synthase (transfers 
CH3 groups as methylcobalamin) and 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Important for 
DNA synthesis.
Found in animal products. Synthesized only 
by intestinal microbiota. Site of synthesis in 
humans is distal to site of absorption; thus B12 
must be consumed via animal products.
Very large reserve pool (several years) stored 
primarily in the liver. Deficiency caused 
by malabsorption (eg, sprue, enteritis, 
Diphyllobothrium latum, achlorhydria, 
bacterial overgrowth, alcohol overuse), lack of 
intrinsic factor (eg, pernicious anemia, gastric 
bypass surgery), absence of terminal ileum 
(surgical resection, eg, for Crohn disease), 
certain drugs (eg, metformin), or insufficient 
intake (eg, veganism).
B9 (folate) supplementation can mask the 
hematologic symptoms of B12 deficiency, but 
not the neurologic symptoms.
DEFICIENCY
Macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia; 
hypersegmented PMNs; paresthesias 
and subacute combined degeneration 
(degeneration of dorsal columns, lateral 
corticospinal tracts, and spinocerebellar tracts) 
due to abnormal myelin. Associated with 
� serum homocysteine and methylmalonic 
acid levels, along with 2° folate deficiency. 
Prolonged deficiency � irreversible nerve 
damage.
Vitamin C
Also called ascorbic acid.
FUNCTION
Antioxidant; also facilitates iron absorption 
by reducing it to Fe2+ state. Necessary 
for hydroxylation of proline and lysine in 
collagen synthesis. Necessary for dopamine 
β-hydroxylase (converts dopamine to NE).
Found in fruits and vegetables.
Pronounce “absorbic” acid.
Ancillary treatment for methemoglobinemia by 
reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+.
DEFICIENCY
Scurvy—swollen gums, easy bruising, 
petechiae, hemarthrosis, anemia, poor wound 
healing, perifollicular and subperiosteal 
hemorrhages, “corkscrew” hair. 
Weakened immune response.
Deficiency may be precipitated by tea and toast 
diet.
Vitamin C deficiency causes sCurvy due to a 
Collagen hydroCylation defect.
EXCESS
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, calcium 
oxalate nephrolithiasis (excess oxalate from 
vitamin C metabolism). Can � iron toxicity in  
predisposed individuals by increasing dietary  
iron absorption (ie, can worsen hemochromatosis  
or transfusion-related iron overload).

Enzyme terminology
An enzyme’s name often describes its function. For example, glucokinase is an enzyme that 
catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose using a molecule of ATP. The following are commonly 
used enzyme descriptors.
Kinase
Catalyzes transfer of a phosphate group from a high-energy molecule (usually ATP) to a substrate 
(eg, phosphofructokinase).
Phosphorylase
Adds inorganic phosphate onto substrate without using ATP (eg, glycogen phosphorylase).
Phosphatase
Removes phosphate group from substrate (eg, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1).
Dehydrogenase
Catalyzes oxidation-reduction reactions (eg, pyruvate dehydrogenase).
Hydroxylase
Adds hydroxyl group (−OH) onto substrate (eg, tyrosine hydroxylase).
Carboxylase
Transfers carboxyl groups (−COOH) with the help of biotin (eg, pyruvate carboxylase).
Mutase
Relocates a functional group within a molecule (eg, vitamin B12–dependent methylmalonyl-CoA 
mutase).
Synthase/synthetase
Joins two molecules together using a source of energy (eg, ATP, acetyl-CoA, nucleotide sugar).

glucokinase
Phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by glucokinase in the liver and 
hexokinase in other tissues. Hexokinase sequesters glucose in tissues, where it is used even when 
glucose concentrations are low. At high glucose concentrations, glucokinase helps to store glucose 
in liver. Glucokinase deficiency is a cause of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and 
gestational diabetes.

Electron transport 
chain and oxidative 
phosphorylation
NADH electrons are transferred to complex I.
FADH2 electrons are transferred to complex II 
(at a lower energy level than NADH).
The passage of electrons results in the formation 
of a proton gradient that, coupled to oxidative 
phosphorylation, drives ATP production. ATP 
hydrolysis can be coupled to energetically 
unfavorable reactions.
Uncoupling proteins (found in brown fat, which 
has more mitochondria than white fat) produce 
heat by � inner mitochondrial membrane 
permeability � � proton gradient. ATP synthesis 
stops, but electron transport continues.
1 NADH � 2.5 ATP; 1 FADH2 � 1.5 ATP
NADH electrons from glycolysis enter 
mitochondria via the malate-aspartate or 
glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle.
Aerobic metabolism of one glucose molecule 
produces 32 net ATP via malate-aspartate 
shuttle (heart and liver), 30 net ATP via 
glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (muscle).
Anaerobic glycolysis produces only 2 net ATP 
per glucose molecule.
Aspirin overdose can also cause uncoupling 
of oxidative phosphorylation resulting in 
hyperthermia.

Glucose-6-
phosphatase
In ER. Glucose-6-phosphate � glucose.
Occurs primarily in liver; serves to maintain euglycemia during fasting. Enzymes also found in 
kidney, intestinal epithelium. Deficiency of the key gluconeogenic enzymes causes hypoglycemia. 
(Muscle cannot participate in gluconeogenesis because it lacks glucose-6-phosphatase).
Odd-chain fatty acids yield 1 propionyl-CoA during metabolism, which can enter the TCA cycle 
(as succinyl-CoA), undergo gluconeogenesis, and serve as a glucose source (It’s odd for fatty acids 
to make glucose). Even-chain fatty acids cannot produce new glucose, since they yield only acetyl-
CoA equivalents.

Pentose phosphate 
pathway
Also called HMP shunt. Provides a source of NADPH from abundantly available glucose-6-P 
(NADPH is required for reductive reactions, eg, glutathione reduction inside RBCs, fatty acid 
and cholesterol biosynthesis). Additionally, this pathway yields ribose for nucleotide synthesis. Two 
distinct phases (oxidative and nonoxidative), both of which occur in the cytoplasm. No ATP is 
used or produced.
Sites: lactating mammary glands, liver, adrenal cortex (sites of fatty acid or steroid synthesis), RBCs.

hemolytic anemia due to poor RBC defense 
against oxidizing agents (eg, fava beans, 
sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, primaquine). 
Infection (most common cause) can also 
precipitate hemolysis; inflammatory response 
produces free radicals that diffuse into RBCs, 
causing oxidative damage.
X-linked recessive disorder; most common 
human enzyme deficiency; more prevalent 
among descendants of populations in malaria-
endemic regions (eg, sub-Saharan Africa, 
Southeast Asia).
Heinz bodies—denatured globin chains 
precipitate within RBCs due to oxidative stress.

Sorbitol
An alternative method of trapping glucose in the cell is to convert it to its alcohol counterpart, 
sorbitol, via aldose reductase. Some tissues then convert sorbitol to fructose using sorbitol 
dehydrogenase; tissues with an insufficient amount/activity of this enzyme are at risk of 
intracellular sorbitol accumulation, causing osmotic damage (eg, cataracts, retinopathy, and 
peripheral neuropathy seen with chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes).
High blood levels of galactose also result in conversion to the osmotically active galactitol via aldose 
reductase.

Lactase deficiency
Insufficient lactase enzyme � dietary lactose intolerance. Lactase functions on the intestinal brush 
border to digest lactose (in milk and milk products) into glucose and galactose.
Primary: age-dependent decline after childhood (absence of lactase-persistent allele), common in 
people of Asian, African, or Native American descent.
Secondary: loss of intestinal brush border due to gastroenteritis (eg, rotavirus), autoimmune disease.
Congenital lactase deficiency: rare, due to defective gene.
Stool demonstrates � pH and breath shows � hydrogen content with lactose hydrogen breath test 
(H+ is produced when colonic bacteria ferment undigested lactose). Intestinal biopsy reveals 
normal mucosa in patients with hereditary lactose intolerance.
FINDINGS
Bloating, cramps, flatulence (all due to fermentation of lactose by colonic bacteria � gas), and 
osmotic diarrhea (undigested lactose).
TREATMENT
Avoid dairy products or add lactase pills to diet; lactose-free milk.

Fatty acid synthesis requires transport of citrate 
from mitochondria to cytosol. Predominantly 
occurs in liver, lactating mammary glands, and 
adipose tissue.
Long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) degradation 
requires carnitine-dependent transport into the 
mitochondrial matrix.
“Sytrate” = synthesis.
Carnitine = carnage of fatty acids.
Systemic 1° carnitine deficiency—no cellular 
uptake of carnitine � no transport of LCFAs 
into mitochondria � toxic accumulation 
of LCFAs in the cytosol. Causes weakness, 
hypotonia, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, dilated 
cardiomyopathy.
Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
deficiency—� ability to break down fatty 
acids into acetyl-CoA � accumulation 
of fatty acyl carnitines in the blood with 
hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Causes vomiting, 
lethargy, seizures, coma, liver dysfunction, 
hyperammonemia. Can lead to sudden death 
in infants or children. Treat by avoiding 
fasting.

Ketone bodies
In the liver, fatty acids and amino acids 
are metabolized to acetoacetate and 
β-hydroxybutyrate (to be used in muscle 
and brain). 
In prolonged starvation and diabetic 
ketoacidosis, oxaloacetate is depleted for 
gluconeogenesis. With chronic alcohol 
overuse, high NADH state leads to 
accumulation of oxaloacetate (downregulated 
TCA cycle), shunting it to malate.
Ketone bodies: acetone, (ketone) acetoacetate 
(ketoacid), β-hydroxybutyrate (ketoacid).
Breath smells like acetone (fruity odor). 
Urine test for ketones can detect acetoacetate, 
but not β-hydroxybutyrate.
RBCs cannot utilize ketone bodies; they strictly 
use glucose. Liver cells lack β ketoacyl-CoA 
transferase � cannot use ketone bodies as fuel.
HMG-CoA lyase for ketone body production.

Blood glucose levels maintained by:
 � Hepatic glycogenolysis 
 � Adipose release of FFA
 � Muscle and liver, which shift fuel use from 
glucose to FFA
 � Hepatic gluconeogenesis from peripheral 
tissue lactate and alanine, and from 
adipose tissue glycerol and propionyl-
CoA (from odd-chain FFA—the only 
triacylglycerol component that contributes 
to gluconeogenesis)

Lipoprotein functions
Lipoproteins are composed of varying proportions of proteins, cholesterol, TGs, and phospholipids. 
LDL and HDL carry the most cholesterol.
Cholesterol is needed to maintain cell membrane integrity and synthesize bile acids, steroids, and 
vitamin D.
Chylomicron
Delivers dietary TGs to peripheral tissues. Delivers cholesterol to liver in the form of chylomicron 
remnants, which are mostly depleted of their TGs. Secreted by intestinal epithelial cells.
VLDL
Delivers hepatic TGs to peripheral tissue. Secreted by liver.
IDL
Delivers TGs and cholesterol to liver. Formed from degradation of VLDL.
LDL
Delivers hepatic cholesterol to peripheral tissues. Formed by hepatic lipase modification of IDL in 
the liver and peripheral tissue. Taken up by target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. LDL is 
Lethal.
HDL 
Mediates reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to liver. Acts as a repository for apoC 
and apoE (which are needed for chylomicron and VLDL metabolism). Secreted from both liver 
and intestine. Alcohol � synthesis. HDL is Healthy.
Abetalipoproteinemia
A
Autosomal recessive. Mutation in gene that encodes microsomal transfer protein (MTP). 
Chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL absent. Deficiency in apo B48– and apo B100–containing lipoproteins. 
Affected infants present with severe fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, failure to thrive. Later 
manifestations include retinitis pigmentosa, spinocerebellar degeneration due to vitamin E 
deficiency, progressive ataxia, acanthocytosis. Intestinal biopsy shows lipid-laden enterocytes 
(arrow in A ).

Functions of natural 
killer cells
Lymphocyte member of innate immune system.
Use perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis of virally infected cells and tumor cells.
Activity enhanced by IL-2, IL-12, IFN-α, and IFN-β.
Induced to kill when exposed to a nonspecific activation signal on target cell and/or to an absence 
of an inhibitory signal such as MHC I on target cell surface.
Also kills via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CD16 binds Fc region of bound IgG, 
activating the NK cell).
Major functions of B and T cells
B cells
Humoral immunity. 
Recognize and present antigen—undergo somatic hypermutation to optimize antigen specificity.
Produce antibody—differentiate into plasma cells to secrete specific immunoglobulins.
Maintain immunologic memory—memory B cells persist and accelerate future response to antigen.
T cells 
Cell-mediated immunity. 
CD4+ T cells help B cells make antibodies and produce cytokines to recruit phagocytes and 
activate other leukocytes.
CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected and tumor cells via perforin and granzymes (similar to NK 
cells).
Delayed cell-mediated hypersensitivity (type IV).
Acute and chronic cellular organ rejection.

Thymic cortex. Double-positive (CD4+/CD8+) T cells expressing TCRs capable of binding self-

Negative selection
Thymic medulla. T cells expressing TCRs with high affinity for self antigens undergo apoptosis or 
become regulatory T cells. Tissue-restricted self-antigens are expressed in the thymus due to the 
action of autoimmune regulator (AIRE); deficiency leads to autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome-1 
(Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, Hypoparathyroidism, Adrenal insufficiency, Recurrent 
Candida infections). “Without AIRE, your body will CHAR”.
Macrophage-
lymphocyte 
interaction
Th1 cells secrete IFN-γ, which enhances the ability of monocytes and macrophages to kill 
microbes they ingest. This function is also enhanced by interaction of T cell CD40L with CD40 
on macrophages. Macrophages also activate lymphocytes via antigen presentation.
Cytotoxic T cells
Kill virus-infected, neoplastic, and donor graft cells by inducing apoptosis.
Release cytotoxic granules containing preformed proteins (eg, perforin, granzyme B).
Cytotoxic T cells have CD8, which binds to MHC I on virus-infected cells.
Regulatory T cells
Help maintain specific immune tolerance by suppressing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell effector 
functions.
Identified by expression of CD3, CD4, CD25, and FOXP3.
Activated regulatory T cells (Tregs) produce anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-10, TGF-β).

T- and B-cell activation
APCs: B cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages.
Two signals are required for T-cell activation, B-cell activation, and class switching.
T-cell activation
  APC ingests and processes antigen, then 
migrates to the draining lymph node.
  T-cell activation (signal 1): exogenous 
antigen is presented on MHC II and 
recognized by TCR on Th (CD4+) cell. 
Endogenous or cross-presented antigen is 
presented on MHC I to Tc (CD8+) cell.
  Proliferation and survival (signal 2): 
costimulatory signal via interaction of B7 
protein (CD80/86) on dendritic cell and 
CD28 on naïve T cell.
  Activated Th cell produces cytokines. Tc cell

isotypes
All isotypes can exist as monomers. Mature, naïve B cells prior to activation express IgM and IgD 
on their surfaces. They may differentiate in germinal centers of lymph nodes by isotype switching 
(gene rearrangement; induced by cytokines and CD40L) into plasma cells that secrete IgA, IgG, 
or IgE. “For B cells, IgMom and IgDad mature to plasma cells as they AGE.
Affinity refers to the individual antibody-antigen interaction, while avidity describes the cumulative

Antigen type and memory
Thymus-independent 
antigens
Antigens lacking a peptide component (eg, lipopolysaccharides from gram ⊝ bacteria); cannot 
be presented by MHC to T cells. Weakly immunogenic; vaccines often require boosters and 
adjuvants (eg, capsular polysaccharide subunit of Streptococcus pneumoniae PPSV23 vaccine).
Thymus-dependent 
antigens
Antigens containing a protein component (eg, diphtheria toxoid). Class switching and immunologic 
memory occur as a result of direct contact of B cells with Th cells.

A part of innate host defense, interferons interfere with both RNA and DNA viruses. Cells 
infected with a virus synthesize these glycoproteins, which act on local cells, priming them 
for viral defense by downregulating protein synthesis to resist potential viral replication and by 
upregulating MHC expression to facilitate recognition of infected cells. Also play a major role in

Hypersensitivity types
Four types (ABCD): Anaphylactic and Atopic (type I), AntiBody-mediated (type II), Immune 
Complex (type III), Delayed (cell-mediated, type IV). Types I, II, and III are all antibody-mediated.
Type I  
hypersensitivity
Anaphylactic and atopic—two phases:
 � Immediate (minutes): antigen crosslinks 
preformed IgE on presensitized mast cells 
� immediate degranulation � release of 
histamine (a vasoactive amine), tryptase 
(marker of mast cell activation), and 
leukotrienes.
 � Late (hours): chemokines (attract 
inflammatory cells, eg, eosinophils) 
and other mediators from mast cells 
� inflammation and tissue damage.
First (type) and Fast (anaphylaxis). 
Test: skin test or blood test (ELISA) for allergen-
specific IgE.
Example:
 � Anaphylaxis (eg, food, drug, or bee sting 
allergies)
 � Allergic asthma
Allergen
Degranulation
Allergen-
speciﬁc IgE
Fc receptor
for IgE
Type II 
hypersensitivity
Antibodies bind to cell-surface antigens or 
extracellular matrix � cellular destruction, 
inflammation, and cellular dysfunction. 
Cellular destruction—cell is opsonized (coated) 
by antibodies, leading to either:
 � Phagocytosis and/or activation of 
complement system.
 � NK cell killing (antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity).
Inflammation—binding of antibodies to cell 
surfaces � activation of complement system 
and Fc receptor-mediated inflammation.
Cellular dysfunction—antibodies bind to  
cell-surface receptors � abnormal blockade or 
activation of downstream process.
Direct Coombs test—detects antibodies 
attached directly to the RBC surface.
Indirect Coombs test—detects presence of 
unbound antibodies in the serum.
Examples:
 � Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (including 
drug-induced form)
 � Immune thrombocytopenia 
 � Transfusion reactions
 � Hemolytic disease of the newborn

Type III 
hypersensitivity
Immune complex—antigen-antibody (mostly 
IgG) complexes activate complement, which 
attracts neutrophils; neutrophils release 
lysosomal enzymes. 
Can be associated with vasculitis and systemic 
manifestations.
In type III reaction, imagine an immune 
complex as 3 things stuck together: antigen-
antibody-complement.
Examples:
 � SLE
 � Rheumatoid arthritis
 � Reactive arthritis
 � Polyarteritis nodosa
 � Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis
 � IgA vasculitis
Neutrophils
Enzymes from 
neutrophils 
damage 
endothelial cells
Serum sickness—the prototypic immune 
complex disease. Antibodies to foreign proteins 
are produced and 1–2 weeks later, antibody-
antigen complexes form and deposit in tissues 
� complement activation � inflammation 
and tissue damage (� serum C3, C4).
Fever, urticaria, arthralgia, proteinuria, 
lymphadenopathy occur 1–2 weeks after 
antigen exposure. Serum sickness–like 
reactions are associated with some drugs (may 
act as haptens, eg, penicillin, monoclonal 
antibodies) and infections (eg, hepatitis B).
Arthus reaction—a local subacute immune 
complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. 
Intradermal injection of antigen into a 
presensitized (has circulating IgG) individual 
leads to immune complex formation in the 
skin (eg, enhanced local reaction to a booster 
vaccination). Characterized by edema, 
fibrinoid necrosis, activation of complement.

Delayed-type
hypersensitivity
Two mechanisms, each involving T cells:
1. Direct cell cytotoxicity: CD8+ cytotoxic T 
cells kill targeted cells.
2. Inflammatory reaction: effector CD4+ 
T cells recognize antigen and release 
inflammation-inducing cytokines (shown 
in illustration).
Response does not involve antibodies (vs types I, 
II, and III).
Examples:
 � Contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy, nickel 
allergy)
 � Drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms (DRESS)
 � Graft-versus-host disease
Tests: PPD for TB infection; patch test for 
contact dermatitis; Candida skin test for T cell 
immune function.
4T’s: T cells, Transplant rejections, TB skin 
tests, Touching (contact dermatitis).

“That within one linear centimeter of your lower colon there lives and 
works more bacteria (about 100 billion) than all humans who have ever 
been born. Yet many people continue to assert that it is we who are in 
charge of the world.” 
—Neil deGrasse Tyson
“What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters  
compared to what lies within us.”

—Kurt Cobain
Microbiology questions on the Step 1 exam often require two (or 
more) steps: Given a certain clinical presentation, you will first need 
to identify the most likely causative organism, and you will then need to 
provide an answer regarding some features of that organism or relevant 
antimicrobial agents. For example, a description of a child with fever 
and a petechial rash will be followed by a question that reads, “From 
what site does the responsible organism usually enter the blood?”
This section therefore presents organisms in two major ways: in 
individual microbial “profiles” and in the context of the systems 
they infect and the clinical presentations they produce. You should 
become familiar with both formats. When reviewing the systems 
approach, remind yourself of the features of each microbe by returning 
to the individual profiles. Also be sure to memorize the laboratory 
characteristics that allow you to identify microbes.

Anaerobes
Examples include Clostridium, Bacteroides, 
Fusobacterium, and Actinomyces israelii. They 
lack catalase and/or superoxide dismutase 
and are thus susceptible to oxidative damage. 
Generally foul smelling (short-chain fatty 
acids), are difficult to culture, and produce gas 
in tissue (CO2 and H2).
Anaerobes Can’t Breathe Fresh Air.
Anaerobes are normal microbiota in GI 
tract, typically pathogenic elsewhere. 
AminO2glycosides are ineffective against 
anaerobes because these antibiotics require O2 
to enter into bacterial cell.
Facultative anaerobes
May use O2 as a terminal electron acceptor to 
generate ATP, but can also use fermentation 
and other O2-independent pathways.

Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, and group B Strep. Their 
capsules serve as an antiphagocytic virulence 
factor. 
Capsular polysaccharide +/– protein conjugate 
can serve as an antigen in vaccines. A 
polysaccharide antigen alone cannot be 
presented to T cells; immunogenicity can be 
enhanced by conjugating capule antigens to a 
carrier protein.

Spore-forming 
bacteria 
Some gram ⊕ bacteria can form spores when 
nutrients are limited. Spores lack metabolic 
activity and are highly resistant to heat 
and chemicals. Core contains dipicolinic 
acid (responsible for heat resistance). Must 
autoclave to kill spores (as is done to surgical 
equipment) by steaming at 121°C for 15 
minutes. Hydrogen peroxide and iodine-based 
agents are also sporicidal.
Examples: B anthracis (anthrax), B cereus (food 
poisoning), C botulinum (botulism), C difficile 
(pseudomembranous colitis), C perfringens 
(gas gangrene), C tetani (tetanus).

(ABC).
Bacterial virulence 
factors
These promote evasion of host immune response.
Capsular 
polysaccharide
Highly charged, hydrophilic structure. Acts as barrier to phagocytosis and complement-mediated 
lysis. Major determinant of virulence.
Protein A
Binds Fc region of IgG. Prevents opsonization and phagocytosis. Expressed by S aureus.
IgA protease
Enzyme that cleaves IgA, allowing bacteria to adhere to and colonize mucous membranes. Secreted 
by S pneumoniae, H influenzae type b, and Neisseria (SHiN).
M protein
Helps prevent phagocytosis. Expressed by group A streptococci. Sequence homology with human 
cardiac myosin (molecular mimicry); possibly underlies the autoimmune response seen in acute 
rheumatic fever.

Bacterial genetics
Transformation
Competent bacteria can bind and import short 
pieces of environmental naked bacterial 
chromosomal DNA (from bacterial cell 
lysis). The transfer and expression of newly 
transferred genes is called transformation. 
A feature of many bacteria, especially 
S pneumoniae, H influenzae type b, and 
Neisseria (SHiN). 
Adding deoxyribonuclease degrades naked 
DNA, preventing transformation.

⊕ cocci in clusters A . Protein A (virulence 
factor) binds Fc-IgG, inhibiting complement 
activation and phagocytosis. Commonly 
colonizes the nares, ears, axilla, and groin.
Causes:
 � Inflammatory disease—skin infections, 
organ abscesses, pneumonia (often after 
influenza virus infection), infective 
endocarditis, septic arthritis, and 
osteomyelitis.
 � Toxin-mediated disease—toxic shock 
syndrome (TSST-1), scalded skin syndrome 
(exfoliative toxin), rapid-onset food 
poisoning (enterotoxins).
MRSA (methicillin-resistant S aureus)—
important cause of serious healthcare-
associated and community-acquired 
infections. Resistance due to altered penicillin-
binding proteins (conferred by mecA gene). 
Some strains release Panton-Valentine 
leukocidin (PVL), which kills leukocytes and 
causes tissue necrosis.
TSST-1 is a superantigen that binds to MHC 
II and T-cell receptor, resulting in polyclonal 
T-cell activation and cytokine release. 
Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS)—
fever, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, desquamation, 
shock, end-organ failure. TSS results in � AST, 
� ALT, � bilirubin. Associated with prolonged 
use of vaginal tampons or nasal packing. 
Compare with Streptococcus pyogenes TSS (a 
toxic shock–like syndrome associated with 
painful skin infection).
S aureus food poisoning due to ingestion of 
preformed toxin � short incubation period

diplococci A .  
Encapsulated. IgA protease. Optochin 
sensitive and bile soluble.
Most commonly causes MOPS: 
 � Meningitis
 � Otitis media (in children)
 � Pneumonia
 � Sinusitis
Pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with 
“rusty” sputum.
Patients with anatomic or functional 
hyposplenia or asplenia are predisposed to 
infection.
No virulence without capsule.
Pneumococcal vaccines are available in both 
conjugate (PCV13, PCV15, PCV20) and 
polysaccharide (PPSV23) formulations.
Viridans group 
streptococci
Gram ⊕, α-hemolytic cocci. Optochin resistant 
and bile insoluble. Normal microbiota of the 
oropharynx.
Streptococcus mutans and S mitis cause dental 
caries. 
S sanguinis makes dextrans that bind to fibrin-
platelet aggregates on damaged heart valves, 
causing infective endocarditis.
Viridans group strep live in the mouth, because 
they are not afraid of-the-chin (op-to-chin 
resistant).
Sanguinis = blood. Think, “there is lots of 
blood in the heart” (infective endocarditis).
Streptococcus

A
Gram ⊕ cocci in chains A . Group A strep 
cause: 
 � Pyogenic—pharyngitis, cellulitis, impetigo 
(“honey-crusted” lesions), erysipelas 
 � Toxigenic—scarlet fever, toxic shock–like 
syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis 
 � Immunologic—rheumatic fever, 
glomerulonephritis
Bacitracin sensitive, β-hemolytic, pyrrolidonyl 
arylamidase (PYR) ⊕. Hyaluronic acid 
capsule and M protein inhibit phagocytosis. 
Antibodies to M protein enhance host defenses. 
Structurally similar to host proteins (ie, myosin); 
can lead to autoimmunity (ie, carditis seen in 
acute rheumatic fever).
Diagnose strep pharyngitis via throat swab, 
which can be tested with an antigen detection 
assay (rapid, in-office results) or cultured on 
blood agar (results in 48 hours).
“Ph”yogenes pharyngitis can result in 
rheumatic “phever” and glomerulonephritis.
Strains causing impetigo can induce 
glomerulonephritis.
Key virulence factors include DNase, 
erythrogenic exotoxin, streptokinase, 
streptolysin O. ASO titer or anti-DNase 
B antibodies indicate recent S pyogenes 
infection.
Scarlet fever—blanching, sandpaperlike body 
rash, strawberry tongue, and circumoral

Polysaccharide capsule confers virulence.
Produces CAMP factor, which enlarges the 
area of hemolysis formed by S aureus. (Note: 
CAMP stands for the authors of the test, not 
cyclic AMP.) Hippurate test ⊕. PYR ⊝.

endocarditis have � incidence of colon cancer.
Bovis in the blood = cancer in the colon.
Enterococci
Gram ⊕ cocci. Enterococci (E faecalis and 
E faecium) are normal colonic microbiota 
that are penicillin G resistant and cause 
UTI, biliary tract infections, and infective 
endocarditis (following GI/GU procedures). 
Catalase ⊝, PYR ⊕, typically nonhemolytic.
VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are 
an important cause of healthcare-associated 
infection. 
Enterococci are more resilient than 
streptococci, can grow in 6.5% NaCl and bile 
(lab test).
Entero = intestine, faecalis = feces, strepto =

Bacillus anthracis
A
Gram ⊕, spore-forming rod that produces anthrax toxin, exotoxins consisting of protective antigen, 
lethal factor (inhibits MAP kinase � macrophage apoptosis), and edema factor (acts as adenylyl 
cyclase � � intracellular cAMP, upsetting homeostasis � edema, necrosis). Has a polypeptide 
capsule (poly d-glutamate). Colonies show a halo of projections, sometimes called “medusa head” 
appearance.
Cutaneous anthrax—painless papule surrounded by vesicles � ulcer with black eschar A  
(painless, necrotic) � uncommonly progresses to bacteremia and death.
Pulmonary anthrax—inhalation of spores, most commonly from contaminated animals or animal 
products, although also a potential bioweapon � flulike symptoms that rapidly progress to fever, 
pulmonary hemorrhage, mediastinitis (CXR may show widened mediastinum), and shock. Also 
called woolsorter’s disease. Prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline when exposed.
Both cutaneous and pulmonary anthrax may be complicated by hemorrhagic meningitis.

Bacillus cereus
Gram ⊕ rod. Causes food poisoning. Spores survive cooking rice (reheated rice syndrome). 
Keeping rice warm results in germination of spores and enterotoxin formation.
Emetic type causes nausea and vomiting within 1–5 hours. Caused by cereulide, a preformed toxin.
Diarrheal type causes watery, nonbloody diarrhea and GI pain within 8–18 hours.
Management: supportive care (antibiotics are ineffective against toxins).
Clostridioides difficile
A
Produces toxins A and B, which damage 
enterocytes. Both toxins lead to watery diarrhea 
� pseudomembranous colitis A. Often 2° 
to antibiotic use, especially clindamycin, 
ampicillin, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones; 
associated with PPIs.
Fulminant infection: toxic megacolon, ileus, 
shock.
Difficile causes diarrhea.
Diagnosed by PCR or antigen detection of one 
or both toxins in stool.
Treatment: oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. 
For recurrent cases, consider repeating prior 
regimen or fecal microbiota transplant.
Clostridia
Gram ⊕, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic rods. Tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin are proteases 
that cleave SNARE proteins involved in neurotransmission.
Clostridium tetani
Pathogen is noninvasive and remains localized 
to wound site. Produces tetanospasmin, an 
exotoxin causing tetanus. Tetanospasmin 
spreads by retrograde axonal transport to CNS 
and blocks release of GABA and glycine from 
Renshaw cells in spinal cord.
Causes spastic paralysis, trismus (lockjaw), risus 
sardonicus (raised eyebrows and open grin), 
opisthotonos (spasms of spinal extensors).
Tetanus is tetanic paralysis. 
Prevent with tetanus vaccine. Treat with antitoxin 
+/− vaccine booster, antibiotics, diazepam (for 
muscle spasms), and wound debridement.
Clostridium botulinum
Produces a heat-labile toxin that inhibits ACh 
release at the neuromuscular junction, causing 
botulism. In babies, ingestion of spores 
(eg, in honey) leads to disease (floppy baby 
syndrome). In adults, disease is caused by 
ingestion of preformed toxin (eg, in canned 
food).
Symptoms of botulism (the 5 D’s): diplopia, 
dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnea, descending 
flaccid paralysis. Does not present with 
sensory deficits.
Botulinum is from bad bottles of food, juice, 
and honey. 
Treatment: human botulinum immunoglobulin. 
Local botulinum toxin A (Botox) injections used 
to treat focal dystonia, hyperhidrosis, muscle 
spasms, and cosmetic reduction of facial 
wrinkles.
Clostridium 
perfringens
A
Produces α-toxin (lecithinase, a phospholipase) 
that can cause myonecrosis (gas gangrene A ; 
presents as soft tissue crepitus) and hemolysis. 
If heavily spore-contaminated food is cooked 
but left standing too long at < 60°C, spores 
germinate � vegetative bacteria � heat-labile 
enterotoxin � late-onset (10-12 hours) food 
poisoning symptoms, resolution in 24 hours.
Perfringens perforates a gangrenous leg.
Spontaneous gas gangrene (via hematogenous 
seeding; associated with colonic malignancy) 
is most commonly caused by Clostridium 
septicum.

Corynebacterium 
diphtheriae
A
Gram ⊕ rods occurring in angular 
arrangements; transmitted via respiratory 
droplets. Causes diphtheria via exotoxin 
encoded by β-prophage. Potent exotoxin 
inhibits protein synthesis via ADP-ribosylation 
of EF-2, leading to possible necrosis in 
pharynx, cardiac, and CNS tissue.
Symptoms include pseudomembranous 
pharyngitis (grayish-white membrane A ) with 
lymphadenopathy (“bull’s neck” appearance). 
Toxin dissemination may cause myocarditis, 
arrhythmias, neuropathies.
Lab diagnosis based on gram ⊕ rods with 
metachromatic (blue and red) granules and 
⊕ Elek test for toxin.

Listeria 
monocytogenes
A
Gram ⊕, facultative intracellular rod; acquired by ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products and 
cold deli meats, transplacental transmission, by vaginal transmission during birth. Grows well at 
refrigeration temperatures (“cold enrichment”). 
Forms “rocket tails” (red in A ) via actin polymerization that allow intracellular movement and cell-
to-cell spread across cell membranes, thereby avoiding antibody. Listeriolysin generates pores in 
phagosomes, allowing its escape into cytoplasm. Characteristic tumbling motility in broth.
Can cause amnionitis, septicemia, and spontaneous abortion in pregnant patients; granulomatosis 
infantiseptica; meningitis in immunocompromised patients, neonates, and older adults; mild, self-
limited gastroenteritis in healthy individuals. 
Treatment: ampicillin.

cannot be grown in vitro. Diagnosed via skin biopsy or tissue PCR. Reservoir in United States: 
armadillos.
Leprosy has 2 forms (many cases fall temporarily between two extremes): 
 � Lepromatous—presents diffusely over the skin, with leonine (lionlike) facies A , and is 
communicable (high bacterial load); characterized by low cell-mediated immunity with a 
largely Th2 response. Lepromatous form can be lethal. 
 � Tuberculoid—limited to a few hypoesthetic, hairless skin plaques B ; characterized by high cell-

A
Small gram ⊝ (coccobacillary) rod. Transmitted 
through respiratory droplets. Nontypeable 
(unencapsulated) strains are the most common 
cause of mucosal infections (otitis media, 
conjunctivitis, bronchitis) as well as invasive 
infections since the vaccine for capsular type b 
was introduced. Produces IgA protease. 
Culture on chocolate agar, which contains 
factors V (NAD+) and X (hematin) for growth; 
can also be grown with S aureus, which 
provides factor V via RBC hemolysis. 
Haemophilus causes epiglottitis (endoscopic 
appearance can be “cherry red” in children; 
“thumb sign” on lateral neck x-ray A ), 
meningitis, otitis media, and pneumonia. 
Vaccine contains type b capsular polysaccharide 
(polyribosylribitol phosphate) conjugated

Bordetella pertussis
Gram ⊝, aerobic coccobacillus. Virulence factors include pertussis toxin (disables Gi), adenylate 
cyclase toxin (� cAMP), and tracheal cytotoxin. Three clinical stages: 
 � Catarrhal—low-grade fevers, coryza.
 � Paroxysmal—paroxysms of intense cough followed by inspiratory “whoop” (“whooping cough”), 
posttussive vomiting.
 � Convalescent—gradual recovery of chronic cough. 
Prevented by Tdap, DTaP vaccines. 
Produces lymphocytosis (unlike most acute bacterial infections).
Treatment: macrolides; if allergic use TMP-SMX.
Brucella
Gram ⊝, aerobic coccobacillus. Transmitted via ingestion of contaminated animal products (eg, 
unpasteurized milk). Survives in macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system. Can form non-
caseating granulomas. Typically presents with undulant fever, night sweats, and arthralgia. 
Treatment: doxycycline + rifampin or streptomycin.
Legionella 
pneumophila
A
Gram ⊝ rod. Gram stains poorly—use silver 
stain. Grow on charcoal yeast extract medium 
with iron and cysteine. Detected by presence of 
antigen in urine. Labs may show hyponatremia. 
Aerosol transmission from environmental water 
source habitat (eg, air conditioning systems, 
hot water tanks). Outbreaks associated with 
cruise ships, nursing homes. No person-to-
person transmission. 
Treatment: macrolide or quinolone. 
Think of a French legionnaire (soldier) with 
his silver helmet, sitting around a campfire 
(charcoal) with his iron dagger—he is missing 
his sister (cysteine).
Legionnaires’ disease—severe pneumonia

A
B
Aeruginosa—aerobic; motile, catalase ⊕, gram ⊝ 
rod. Non-lactose fermenting. Oxidase ⊕. 
Frequently found in water. Increased virulence 
in acidic environments. Has a grapelike odor.
PSEUDOMONAS is associated with: 
Pneumonia, Sepsis, Ecthyma gangrenosum, 
UTIs, Diabetes, Osteomyelitis, Mucoid 
polysaccharide capsule, Otitis externa 
(swimmer’s ear), Nosocomial (healthcare-
associated) infections (eg, catheters, 
equipment), Addiction (injection drug use), 
Skin infections (eg, hot tub folliculitis, wound 
infection in burn victims).
Mucoid polysaccharide capsule may contribute 
to chronic pneumonia in patients with cystic 
fibrosis due to biofilm formation.
Produces PEEP: Phospholipase C (degrades 
cell membranes); Endotoxin (fever, shock); 
Exotoxin A (inactivates EF-2); Pigments: 
pyoverdine and pyocyanin (blue-green 
pigment A ; also generates ROS).
Corneal ulcers/keratitis in contact lens wearers/
minor eye trauma.
Ecthyma gangrenosum—rapidly progressive, 
necrotic cutaneous lesion B  caused by 
Pseudomonas bacteremia. Typically seen in 
immunocompromised patients.
Treatments:
 � Antipseudomonal penicillins in combination 
with β-lactamase inhibitor (eg, piperacillin-
tazobactam)
 � 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins (eg, 
ceftazidime, cefepime) 
 � Monobactams 
 � Fluoroquinolones 
 � Carbapenems
Despite antipseudomonal activity,

Gram ⊝, flagellated, comma shaped A , oxidase ⊕, grows in alkaline media. Endemic to 
developing countries. Produces profuse rice-water diarrhea via enterotoxin that permanently 
activates Gs, � cAMP. Sensitive to stomach acid (acid labile); requires large inoculum (high ID50) 
unless host has � gastric acidity. Transmitted via ingestion of contaminated water or uncooked 
food (eg, raw shellfish). Treat promptly with oral rehydration solution.
Vibrio vulnificus—gram ⊝ bacillus, usually found in marine environments. Causes severe wound 
infections or septicemia due to exposure to contaminated sea water. Presents as cellulitis that 
can progress to necrotizing fasciitis in high-risk patients, especially those with liver disease (eg, 
cirrhosis, hemochromatosis). Serious wound infection requires surgical debridement.
Helicobacter pylori
A
Curved, flagellated (motile), gram ⊝ rod A  that is triple ⊕: catalase ⊕, oxidase ⊕, and urease ⊕ 
(can use urea breath test or fecal antigen test for diagnosis). Urease produces ammonia, creating 
an alkaline environment, which helps H pylori survive in acidic mucosa. Colonizes mainly 
antrum of stomach; causes gastritis and peptic ulcers (especially duodenal). Risk factor for peptic 
ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and MALT lymphoma.
Most common initial treatment is triple therapy: amoxicillin (metronidazole if penicillin allergy)

Chlamydiae
A
Chlamydiae cannot make their own ATP. They 
are obligate intracellular organisms that cause 
mucosal infections. 2 forms:
 � Elementary body (small, dense) 
is “enfectious” and enters cell via 
endocytosis; transforms into reticulate body.
 � Reticulate body replicates in cell by fission; 
reorganizes into elementary bodies.
Chlamydia trachomatis causes neonatal 
and follicular adult conjunctivitis A, 
nongonococcal urethritis, PID, and reactive 
arthritis.
Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydophila 
psittaci cause atypical pneumonia; transmitted 
by aerosol.
Chlamydial cell wall lacks classic peptidoglycan 
(due to reduced muramic acid), rendering 
β-lactam antibiotics ineffective.
Chlamys = cloak (intracellular).
C psittaci—has an avian reservoir (parrots), 
causes atypical pneumonia.
Lab diagnosis: PCR, NAAT. Cytoplasmic 
inclusions (reticulate bodies) seen on Giemsa 
or fluorescent antibody–stained smear.
Treatment: doxycycline, azithromycin (for 
pregnant patients). Add ceftriaxone for possible 
concomitant gonorrhea.
Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes
Types A, B, and C
Chronic infection, cause blindness due to 
follicular conjunctivitis in resource-limited 
areas.
ABC = Africa, Blindness, Chronic infection.
Types D–K
Urethritis/PID, ectopic pregnancy, neonatal 
pneumonia (staccato cough) with eosinophilia, 
neonatal conjunctivitis (1–2 weeks after birth).
D–K = everything else.
Neonatal disease can be acquired during vaginal 
birth if pregnant patient is infected.

Gardnerella vaginalis
A
A pleomorphic, gram-variable rod involved in 
bacterial vaginosis. Presents as a gray vaginal 
discharge with a fishy smell; nonpainful (vs 
vaginitis). Associated with sexual activity,  
but not sexually transmitted. Bacterial 
vaginosis is also characterized by overgrowth 
of certain anaerobic bacteria in vagina (due 
to � lactobacilli). Clue cells (vaginal epithelial 
cells covered with Gardnerella) have stippled 
appearance along outer margin (arrow in A).
Amine whiff test—mixing discharge with 10% 
KOH enhances fishy odor.
Vaginal pH >4.5 during infection.

Treatment: doxycycline.
rasH commoN
Rocky Mountain 
spotted fever
Rickettsia rickettsii, vector is tick. Despite its 
name, disease occurs primarily in the South 
Atlantic states, especially North Carolina. 
Rash typically starts at wrists A  and ankles and 
then spreads to trunk, palms, and soles.
Classic triad—headache, fever, rash (vasculitis). 
Palms and soles rash is seen in Coxsackievirus 
A infection (hand, foot, and mouth disease), 
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and 2° Syphilis 
(you drive CARS using your palms and soles).
Typhus
Endemic (fleas)—R typhi. 
Epidemic (human body louse)—R prowazekii. 
Rash starts centrally and spreads out, sparing 
palms and soles.
Rickettsii on the wrists, typhus on the trunk.
rasH rare
Ehrlichiosis
Ehrlichia, vector is tick. Monocytes with 
morulae B  (mulberrylike inclusions) in 
cytoplasm.
MEGA:
Monocytes = Ehrlichiosis
Granulocytes = Anaplasmosis
Anaplasmosis
Anaplasma, vector is tick. Granulocytes with 
morulae C  in cytoplasm.
Q fever
Coxiella burnetii, no arthropod vector. 
Bacterium inhaled as aerosols from cattle/
sheep amniotic fluid. Presents with headache, 
cough, flulike symptoms, pneumonia, possibly 
in combination with hepatitis. Common cause 
of culture ⊝ endocarditis.
Q fever is caused by a Quite Complicated 
bug because it has no rash or vector and its 
causative organism can survive outside in its 
endospore form. Not in the Rickettsia genus, 
but closely related.

Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae
A
Classic cause of atypical “walking pneumonia” 
(insidious onset, headache, nonproductive 
cough, patchy or diffuse interstitial infiltrate, 
macular rash). 
Occurs frequently in those <30 years old; 
outbreaks in military recruits, prisons, colleges.
Treatment: macrolides, doxycycline, or 
fluoroquinolone (penicillin ineffective since 
Mycoplasma has no cell wall).
Not seen on Gram stain. Pleomorphic A .  
Bacterial membrane contains sterols for 
stability. Grown on Eaton agar.
CXR appears more severe than patient 
presentation. High titer of cold agglutinins (IgM), 
which can agglutinate RBCs. Mycoplasma gets 
cold without a coat (no cell wall).
Can cause atypical variant of Stevens-
Johnson syndrome, typically in children and 
adolescents.

Systemic mycoses
All of the following can cause pneumonia and can disseminate. 
All are caused by dimorphic fungi: cold (20°C) = mold; heat (37°C) = yeast. Only exception is 
Coccidioides, which is a spherule (not yeast) in tissue. 
Systemic mycoses can form granulomas (like TB); cannot be transmitted person-to-person (unlike TB). 
Treatment: fluconazole or itraconazole for local infection; amphotericin B for systemic infection.

Opportunistic fungal infections
Candida albicans
alba = white. Dimorphic; forms pseudohyphae and budding yeasts at 20°C A , germ tubes at 
37°C B .
Systemic or superficial fungal infection. Causes oral C  and esophageal thrush in 
immunocompromised (neonates, steroids, diabetes, AIDS), vulvovaginitis (diabetes, use of 
antibiotics), diaper rash, infective endocarditis (people who inject drugs), disseminated candidiasis 
(especially in neutropenic patients), chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
Treatment: oral fluconazole/topical azoles for vaginal; nystatin, azoles, or, rarely, echinocandins for 
oral; fluconazole, echinocandins, or amphotericin B for esophageal or systemic disease.
Aspergillus
fumigatus
Acute angle (45°) D branching of septate hyphae.
Causes invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients, especially those with neutrophil 
dysfunction (eg, chronic granulomatous disease) because Aspergillus is catalase ⊕.
Can cause aspergillomas E  in pre-existing lung cavities, especially after TB infection.
Some species of Aspergillus produce aflatoxins (induce TP53 mutations leading to hepatocellular 
carcinoma).
Treatment: voriconazole or echinocandins (2nd-line).
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)—hypersensitivity response to Aspergillus growing in 
lung mucus. Associated with asthma and cystic fibrosis; may cause bronchiectasis and eosinophilia.
Cryptococcus
neoformans
5–10 μm with narrow budding. Heavily encapsulated yeast. Not dimorphic. ⊕ PAS staining.
Found in soil, pigeon droppings. Acquired through inhalation with hematogenous dissemination 
to meninges. Highlighted with India ink (clear halo F ) and mucicarmine (red inner capsule G). 
Latex agglutination test detects polysaccharide capsular antigen and is more sensitive and specific.
Causes cryptococcosis, which can manifest with meningitis, pneumonia, and/or encephalitis (“soap 
bubble” lesions in brain), primarily in immunocompromised.
Treatment: amphotericin B + flucytosine followed by fluconazole for cryptococcal meningitis.
Mucor and Rhizopus
spp
Irregular, broad, nonseptate hyphae branching at wide angles H.
Causes mucormycosis, mostly in patients with DKA and/or neutropenia (eg, leukemia). Inhalation 
of spores � fungi proliferate in blood vessel walls, penetrate cribriform plate, and enter brain. 
Rhinocerebral, frontal lobe abscess; cavernous sinus thrombosis. Headache, facial pain, black 
necrotic eschar on face I ; may have cranial nerve involvement.
Treatment: surgical debridement, amphotericin B or isavuconazole.

Pneumocystis jirovecii
Causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a diffuse interstitial pneumonia A . Yeastlike fungus 
(originally classified as protozoan). Most infections are asymptomatic. Immunosuppression (eg, 
AIDS) predisposes to disease. Diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest imaging, with 
pneumatoceles B . Diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy. Disc-shaped yeast seen on 
methenamine silver stain of lung tissue C  or with fluorescent antibody.
Treatment/prophylaxis: TMP-SMX, pentamidine, dapsone (prophylaxis as single agent, or 
treatment in combination with TMP), atovaquone. Start prophylaxis when CD4+ cell count drops 
to < 200 cells/mm3 in people living with HIV.

Sporothrix schenckii
A
Causes sporotrichosis. Dimorphic fungus. Exists as a cigar-shaped yeast at 37 ºC in the human 
body and as hyphae with spores in soil (conidia). Lives on vegetation. When spores are 
traumatically introduced into the skin, typically by a thorn (“rose gardener’s disease”), causes 
local pustule or ulcer with nodules along draining lymphatics (ascending lymphangitis A ). 
Disseminated disease possible in immunocompromised host. 
Treatment: itraconazole or potassium iodide (only for cutaneous/lymphocutaneous).
Think of a rose gardener who smokes a cigar and pot.

regions (pubic lice).
Body lice can transmit Rickettsia prowazekii 
(epidemic typhus), Borrelia recurrentis 
(relapsing fever), Bartonella quintana (trench 
fever).
Treatment: pyrethroids, malathion, or 
ivermectin lotion, and nit B  combing. 
Children with head lice can be treated at 
home without interrupting school attendance.
Cimex lectularius and 
Cimex hemipterus
Bed bugs. Blood-feeding insects that infest 
dwellings. Painless bites result in a range of 
skin reactions, typically pruritic, erythematous 
papules with central hemorrhagic punctum. 
A clustered or linear pattern of bites seen 
upon awakening is suggestive. Diagnosis is 
confirmed by direct identification of bed bugs 
in patient’s dwelling.
Bed bugs can spread among rooms; cohabitants 
may exhibit similar symptoms. Infestations can 
also spread via travelers from infested hotels and 
the use of unwashed, used bedding. 
Treatment: bites self resolve within 1 week. 
Eradication of the infestation is critical.

=
Reassortment
When viruses with segmented genomes (eg, 
influenza virus) exchange genetic material. 
For example, the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza 
A pandemic emerged via complex viral 
reassortment of genes from human, swine, and 
avian viruses. Has potential to cause antigenic 
shift. Reassortment of genome segments.
 +

Complementation
When 1 of 2 viruses that infect the cell has 
a mutation that results in a nonfunctional 
protein, the nonmutated virus “complements” 
the mutated one by making a functional

of virus A can be partially or completely 
coated (forming pseudovirion) with the 
surface proteins of virus B. Type B protein 
coat determines the tropism (infectivity) of 
the hybrid virus. Progeny from subsequent

Viral genomes
Naked nucleic acids of most dsDNA viruses (except poxviruses and HBV) and ⊕ strand ssRNA 
viruses are infectious. Naked nucleic acids of ⊝ strand ssRNA and dsRNA viruses are not 
infectious because they lack the required polymerases to replicate. Virions of ⊝ strand ssRNA 
viruses carry RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to transcribe ⊝ strand to ⊕.

Picornavirus
Includes Poliovirus, Echovirus, Rhinovirus, 
Coxsackievirus, and HAV. RNA is translated 
into 1 large polypeptide that is cleaved by  
virus-encoded proteases into functional  
viral proteins. Poliovirus, echovirus, and 
coxsackievirus are enteroviruses and can cause 
aseptic (viral) meningitis.
PicoRNAvirus = small RNA virus.
PERCH on a “peak” (pico).
Rhinovirus
A picornavirus. Nonenveloped RNA virus. 
Cause of common cold; > 100 serologic 
types. Acid labile—destroyed by stomach acid; 
therefore, does not infect the GI tract (unlike 
the other picornaviruses).
Rhino has a runny nose.
Rotavirus
A
Segmented dsRNA virus (a reovirus) A . 
Most important global cause of infantile 
gastroenteritis. Major cause of acute diarrhea 
in the United States during winter, especially 
in day care centers, kindergartens. 
Villous destruction with atrophy leads to 
� absorption of Na+ and loss of K+.
Rotavirus = right out the anus.
CDC recommends routine vaccination of 
all infants except those with a history of 
intussusception (rare adverse effect of rotavirus 
vaccination) or SCID.

Influenza viruses
Orthomyxoviruses. Enveloped, ⊝ ssRNA 
viruses with segmented genome. Contain 
hemagglutinin (binds sialic acid and promotes 
viral entry) and neuraminidase (promotes 
progeny virion release) antigens. Patients at risk 
for fatal bacterial superinfection, most commonly 
S aureus, S pneumoniae, and H influenzae. 
Treatment: supportive +/– neuraminidase 
inhibitor (eg, oseltamivir, zanamivir).
Hemagglutinin: lets the virus in
Neuraminidaways: sends the virus away
Reformulated vaccine (“the flu shot”) contains 
viral strains most likely to appear during the flu 
season, due to the virus’ rapid genetic change.
Killed viral vaccine is most frequently used.
Live attenuated vaccine contains temperature-
sensitive mutant that replicates in the nose but 
not in the lung; administered intranasally.
Sudden shift is more deadly than gradual drift.
Genetic/antigenic 
shift
Infection of 1 cell by 2 different segmented viruses (eg, swine influenza and human influenza viruses) 
� RNA segment reassortment � dramatically different virus (genetic shift) � major global outbreaks 
(pandemics).

other lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and fine, maculopapular rash that starts on face and spreads 
centrifugally to involve trunk and extremities A . 
Causes mild disease in children but serious congenital disease (a TORCH infection). Congenital 
rubella findings include classic triad of sensorineural deafness, cataracts, and patent ductus 
arteriosus. “Blueberry muffin” appearance may be seen due to dermal extramedullary 
hematopoiesis. 
Paramyxoviruses
Paramyxoviruses cause disease in children. They include those that cause parainfluenza (croup), 
mumps, measles, RSV, and human metapneumovirus. All subtypes can cause respiratory tract 
infection (bronchiolitis, pneumonia) in infants. All contain surface F (fusion) protein, which 
causes respiratory epithelial cells to fuse and form multinucleated cells. Palivizumab (monoclonal 
antibody against F protein) prevents pneumonia caused by RSV infection in premature infants.

antigens. Results in a “seal-like” barking cough and inspiratory stridor. Narrowing of upper trachea 
and subglottis leads to characteristic steeple sign on x-ray A .
Measles (rubeola) 
virus
A
Usual presentation involves prodromal fever 
with cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, then 
eventually Koplik spots (bright red spots with 
blue-white center on buccal mucosa A ), 
followed 1–2 days later by a maculopapular 
rash that starts at the head/neck and spreads 
downward. 
Lymphadenitis with Warthin-Finkeldey giant 
cells (fused lymphocytes) in a background of 
paracortical hyperplasia. Possible sequelae:
 � Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE): 
personality changes, dementia, autonomic 
dysfunction, death (occurs years later)
 � Encephalitis (1:1000): symptoms appear 
within few days of rash
 � Giant cell pneumonia (rare except in 
immunosuppressed)

Mumps virus
A
Uncommon due to effectiveness of MMR 
vaccine.
Symptoms: Parotitis A , Orchitis (inflammation

Dengue hemorrhagic fever: dengue fever + 
bleeding and plasma leakage due to severe 
thrombocytopenia and RBC perturbations.

care, no definitive treatment.
Diagnose with RT-PCR or serology.
Sexual and vertical transmission occurs. 
In pregnancy, can lead to miscarriage or congenital Zika syndrome: brain imaging shows 
ventriculomegaly, subcortical calcifications. Clinical features in the affected newborn include

B
Bullet-shaped virus A . Negri bodies 
(cytoplasmic inclusions B ) commonly 
found in Purkinje cells of cerebellum and 
in hippocampal neurons. Rabies has long 
incubation period (weeks to months) before 
symptom onset. Postexposure prophylaxis 
is wound cleaning plus immunization with 
killed vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin. 
Example of passive-active immunity.
Travels to the CNS by migrating in a retrograde 
fashion (via dynein motors) up nerve axons 
after binding to ACh receptors.
Progression of disease: fever, malaise 
� agitation, photophobia, hydrophobia, 
hypersalivation � paralysis, coma � death.
Infection more commonly from bat, raccoon, and 
skunk bites than from dog bites in the United 
States; aerosol transmission (eg, bat caves) also 
possible.
Ebola virus
A
A filovirus A . Following an incubation period 
of up to 21 days, presents with abrupt onset 
of flulike symptoms, diarrhea/vomiting, high 
fever, myalgia. Can progress to DIC, diffuse 
hemorrhage, shock. 
Diagnosed with RT-PCR within 48 hr of 
symptom onset. High mortality rate.
Transmission requires direct contact with bodily 
fluids, fomites (including dead bodies), infected 
bats or primates (apes/monkeys); high incidence 
of healthcare-associated infection.
Supportive care, no definitive treatment. 
Vaccination of contacts, strict isolation of infected 
individuals, and barrier practices for healthcare 
workers are key to preventing transmission.

Severe acute 
respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel ⊕ ssRNA coronavirus 
and the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Clinical course varies from asymptomatic to 
critical; most infections are mild.
Predominant presenting symptoms can differ by 
variant:
 � Common: fever, myalgia, headache, nasal 
congestion, sneezing, cough, sore throat, GI 
symptoms (eg, nausea, diarrhea).
 � More specific: anosmia (loss of smell), 
dysgeusia (altered taste).
Pneumonia is the most frequent serious 
manifestation, but complications can 
include acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
hypercoagulability (� thromboembolic 
complications including DVT, PE, stroke), 
myocardial injury, neurologic sequelae, shock, 
organ failure, death.
Strongest risk factors for severe illness or death 
include advanced age and pre-existing medical 
comorbidities (eg, obesity, hypertension).
Diagnosed by NAAT (most commonly  
RT-PCR). Tests detecting viral antigen are 
rapid and more accessible, but typically less 
sensitive than NAATs; negative results may 
warrant additional testing if there is a high 
suspicion of disease.
Spreads through respiratory particles. Host 
cell entry occurs by attachment of viral spike 
protein to ACE2 receptor on cell membranes. 
Anti-spike protein antibodies confer immunity.
Vaccination (primary series and booster) 
induces humoral and cellular immunity, 
which decreases risk of contracting or 
transmitting the virus and confers high rates of 
protection against severe disease and death.
Virus-specific options include antivirals 
(remdesivir, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 
molnupiravir), and antibody-based therapies. 
Therapies directed against the inflammatory 
response include dexamethasone and 
immunomodulators (baricitinib, IL-6 pathway 
inhibitors).

Hepatitis 
viruses
Signs and symptoms of all hepatitis viruses: episodes of fever, jaundice, � ALT and AST. Naked viruses (HAV 
and HEV) lack an envelope and are not destroyed by the gut: the vowels hit your bowels. 
HBV DNA polymerase has DNA- and RNA-dependent activities. Upon entry into nucleus, the polymerase 
completes the partial dsDNA. Host RNA polymerase transcribes mRNA from viral DNA to make viral 
proteins. The DNA polymerase then reverse transcribes viral RNA to DNA, which is the genome of the 
progeny virus. 
HCV lacks 3′-5′ exonuclease activity � no proofreading ability � antigenic variation of HCV envelope 
proteins. Host antibody production lags behind production of new mutant strains of HCV.

Diploid genome (2 molecules of RNA).
The 3 structural genes (protein coded for):
 � Env (gp120 and gp41)—formed from cleavage 
of gp160 to form envelope glycoproteins.
 � gp120—attachment to host CD4+ T cell.
 � gp41 (forty-one)—fusion and entry. 
 � gag (p24 and p17)—capsid and matrix 
proteins, respectively.
 � pol—Reverse transcriptase, Integrase, 
Protease; RIP “Pol” (Paul)
Reverse transcriptase synthesizes dsDNA from 
genomic RNA; dsDNA integrates into host 
genome. 
Virus binds CD4 as well as a coreceptor, either 
CCR5 on macrophages (early infection) or 
CXCR4 on T cells (late infection). 
Homozygous CCR5 mutation = immunity.
Heterozygous CCR5 mutation = slower course.

HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab immunoassays detect viral p24 
antigen capsid protein and IgG and/or IgM to 
HIV-1/2.
 � Use for diagnosis. Very high sensitivity/
specificity, but may miss early HIV disease if 
tested within first 2 weeks of infection.
 � A positive screening test is followed by 
a confirmatory HIV-1/2 differentiation 
immunoassay.
HIV RNA tests detect elevated HIV RNA and 
can be qualitative or quantitative.
 � NAAT is qualitative, and is a sensitive 
method to detect HIV viremia in antibody-
negative patients.
 � Viral load tests (RT-PCR) are quantitative 
and determine amount of viral RNA in 
the plasma. Use to monitor response to 
treatment and transmissibility.
Western blot tests are no longer recommended 
by the CDC for confirmatory testing.
HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab testing is not recommended in 
babies with suspected HIV due to maternally 
transferred antibody. Use HIV viral load instead.

Prions
Prion diseases are caused by the conversion of a normal (predominantly α-helical) protein termed 
prion protein (PrPc) to a β-pleated form (PrPsc), which is transmissible via CNS-related tissue 
(iatrogenic CJD) or food contaminated by BSE-infected animal products (variant CJD). PrPsc 
resists protease degradation and facilitates the conversion of still more PrPc to PrPsc. Resistant to 
standard sterilizing procedures, including standard autoclaving. Accumulation of PrPsc results in 
spongiform encephalopathy and dementia, ataxia, startle myoclonus, and death. 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—rapidly progressive dementia, typically sporadic (some familial forms).
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy—also called “mad cow disease.”
Kuru—acquired prion disease noted in tribal populations practicing human cannibalism.

Urinary tract 
infections
Cystitis presents with dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, and WBCs (but not WBC 
casts) in urine. Primarily caused by ascension of microbes from urethra to bladder. Ascension to 
kidney results in pyelonephritis, which presents with fever, chills, flank pain, costovertebral angle 
tenderness, hematuria, and WBC casts. 
Ten times more common in females (shorter urethras colonized by fecal microbiota).

“Digressions, objections, delight in mockery, carefree mistrust are signs of 
health; everything unconditional belongs in pathology.”
—Friedrich Nietzsche
“You cannot separate passion from pathology any more than you can 
separate a person’s spirit from his body.”
—Richard Selzer
“My business is not prognosis, but diagnosis. I am not engaged in 
therapeutics, but in pathology.”
—H.L. Mencken
The fundamental principles of pathology are key to understanding 
diseases in all organ systems. Major topics such as inflammation and 
neoplasia appear frequently in questions across different organ systems, 
and such topics are definitely high yield. For example, the concepts of 
cell injury and inflammation are key to understanding the inflammatory 
response that follows myocardial infarction, a very common subject of 
board questions. Similarly, a familiarity with the early cellular changes 
that culminate in the development of neoplasias—for example, 
esophageal or colon cancer—is critical. Make sure you recognize the 
major tumor-associated genes and are comfortable with key cancer 
concepts such as tumor staging and metastasis. Finally, take some time 
to learn about the major systemic changes that come with aging, and 
how these physiologic alterations differ from disease states.

` PATHOLOGY—CeLLuLAr InjurY
Cellular adaptations
Reversible changes that can be physiologic (eg, uterine enlargement during pregnancy) or pathologic 
(eg, myocardial hypertrophy 2° to systemic HTN). If stress is excessive or persistent, adaptations 
can progress to cell injury (eg, significant LV hypertrophy � myocardial injury � HF).
Hypertrophy 
� structural proteins and organelles � � in size of cells. Example: cardiac hypertrophy.
Hyperplasia
Controlled proliferation of stem cells and differentiated cells � � in number of cells (eg, benign 
prostatic hyperplasia). Excessive stimulation � pathologic hyperplasia (eg, endometrial 
hyperplasia), which may progress to dysplasia and cancer.
Atrophy
� in tissue mass due to � in size (� cytoskeleton degradation via ubiquitin- proteasome pathway 
and autophagy; � protein synthesis) and/or number of cells (apoptosis). Causes include disuse, 
denervation, loss of blood supply, loss of hormonal stimulation, poor nutrition.
Metaplasia
Reprogramming of stem cells � replacement of one cell type by another that can adapt to a new 
stress. Usually due to exposure to an irritant, such as gastric acid (� Barrett esophagus) or tobacco 
smoke (� respiratory ciliated columnar epithelium replaced by stratified squamous epithelium). 
May progress to dysplasia � malignant transformation with persistent insult (eg, Barrett 
esophagus � esophageal adenocarcinoma). Metaplasia of connective tissue can also occur  
(eg, myositis ossificans, the formation of bone within muscle after trauma). 
Dysplasia
Disordered, precancerous epithelial cell growth; not considered a true adaptive response. 
Characterized by loss of uniformity of cell size and shape (pleomorphism); loss of tissue 
orientation; nuclear changes (eg, � nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio and clumped chromatin). Mild and 
moderate dysplasias (ie, do not involve entire thickness of epithelium) may regress with alleviation 
of inciting cause. Severe dysplasia often becomes irreversible and progresses to carcinoma in situ. 
Usually preceded by persistent metaplasia or pathologic hyperplasia.

Apoptosis 
ATP-dependent programmed cell death.
Intrinsic, extrinsic, and perforin/granzyme B pathways � activate caspases (cytosolic proteases) 
� cellular breakdown including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, 
and formation of apoptotic bodies, which are then phagocytosed.
Characterized by deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm and basophilic nucleus, pyknosis, and karyorrhexis.
Cell membrane typically remains intact without significant inflammation (unlike necrosis).
DNA laddering (fragments in multiples of 180 bp) is a sensitive indicator of apoptosis.
Intrinsic 
(mitochondrial) 
pathway 
Involved in tissue remodeling in embryogenesis. Occurs when a regulating factor is withdrawn 
from a proliferating cell population (eg, � IL-2 after a completed immunologic reaction 
� apoptosis of proliferating effector cells). Also occurs after exposure to injurious stimuli (eg, 
radiation, toxins, hypoxia). 
Regulated by Bcl-2 family of proteins. BAX and BAK are proapoptotic (BAd for survival), while 
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are antiapoptotic (Be clever, live).
BAX and BAK form pores in the mitochondrial membrane � release of cytochrome C from inner 
mitochondrial membrane into the cytoplasm � activation of caspases.
Bcl-2 keeps the mitochondrial membrane impermeable, thereby preventing cytochrome C release. 
Bcl-2 overexpression (eg, follicular lymphoma t[14;18]) � � caspase activation � tumorigenesis. 
Extrinsic (death 
receptor) pathway
Ligand receptor interactions: FasL binding to Fas (CD95) or TNF-α binding to its receptor.
Fas-FasL interaction is necessary in thymic medullary negative selection. 
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome—caused by defective Fas-FasL interaction � failure 
of clonal deletion � � numbers of self-reacting lymphocytes. Presents with lymphadenopathy, 
hepatosplenomegaly, autoimmune cytopenias.

limited collateral vascularity. These areas are susceptible to ischemia from hypoperfusion.
bNeurons most vulnerable to hypoxic-ischemic insults include Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and 
pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and neocortex (layers 3, 5, 6).
Types of infarcts
Red infarct
Occurs in venous occlusion and tissues with 
multiple blood supplies (eg, liver, lung A , 
intestine, testes), and with reperfusion (eg, 
after angioplasty). Reperfusion injury is due to 
damage by free radicals.
A
B
Pale infarct
Occurs in solid organs with a single (end-
arterial) blood supply (eg, heart B , kidney).
Free radical injury
Free radicals damage cells via membrane lipid peroxidation, protein modification, DNA breakage. 
Initiated via radiation exposure (eg, cancer therapy), metabolism of drugs (phase I), redox 
reactions, nitric oxide (eg, inflammation), transition metals (eg, iron, copper; form free radicals 
via Fenton reaction), WBC (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) oxidative burst.
Free radicals can be eliminated by scavenging enzymes (eg, catalase, superoxide dismutase, 
glutathione peroxidase), spontaneous decay, antioxidants (eg, vitamins A, C, E), and certain metal 
carrier proteins (eg, transferrin, ceruloplasmin).
Examples:
 � Oxygen toxicity: retinopathy of prematurity (abnormal vascularization), bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia, reperfusion injury after thrombolytic therapy
 � Drug/chemical toxicity: acetaminophen overdose (hepatotoxicity), carbon tetrachloride 
(converted by cytochrome P-450 into CCl3 free radical � fatty liver [cell injury 
� � apolipoprotein synthesis � fatty change], centrilobular necrosis)
 � Metal storage diseases: hemochromatosis (iron) and Wilson disease (copper)

Ionizing radiation 
toxicity
Ionizing radiation causes DNA (eg, double 
strand breaks) and cellular damage both 
directly and indirectly through the production 
of free radicals. Complications usually arise 
when patient is exposed to significant doses 
(eg, radiotherapy, nuclear reactor accidents):
 � Localized inflammation and fibrosis
 � Neoplasia (eg, leukemia, thyroid cancer)
Acute radiation syndrome—develops after 
sudden whole-body exposure to high doses 
of ionizing radiation � nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, hair loss, erythema, cytopenias, 
headache, altered mental status.
Stem cells of rapidly regenerating tissues (eg, 
skin, bone marrow, GI tract, gonads) are the 
most susceptible to radiation injury.
Radiotherapy damages cancer cells more 
than healthy cells because cancer cells have 
dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms in 
addition to high replicative rates.

Inflammation
Response to eliminate initial cause of cell injury, to remove necrotic cells resulting from the 
original insult, and to initiate tissue repair. Divided into acute and chronic. The inflammatory 
response itself can be harmful to the host if the reaction is excessive (eg, septic shock), prolonged 
(eg, persistent infections such as TB), or inappropriate (eg, autoimmune diseases such as SLE).

Tumor nomenclature
Carcinoma implies epithelial origin, whereas sarcoma denotes mesenchymal origin. Both terms 
generally imply malignancy. 
Benign tumors are usually well-differentiated and well-demarcated, with low mitotic activity, no 
metastases, and no necrosis.
Malignant tumors (cancers) may show poor differentiation, erratic growth, local invasion, 
metastasis, and � apoptosis. 
Terms for non-neoplastic malformations include hamartoma (disorganized overgrowth of tissues in 
their native location, eg, Peutz-Jeghers polyps) and choristoma (normal tissue in a foreign location, 
eg, gastric tissue located in distal ileum in Meckel diverticulum).

Hallmarks of cancer

(eg, growth, DNA repair, survival).
HALLmArK

Growth signal  
self-sufficiency
Mutations in genes encoding:
 � Proto-oncogenes � � growth factors � autocrine loop (eg, � PDGF in brain tumors)
 � Growth factor receptors � constitutive signaling (eg, HER2 in breast cancer)
 � Signaling molecules (eg, RAS) 
 � Transcription factors (eg, MYC)
 � Cell cycle regulators (eg, cyclins, CDKs)
Anti-growth signal 
insensitivity
 � Mutations in tumor suppressor genes (eg, Rb)
 � Loss of E-cadherin function � loss of contact inhibition (eg, NF2 mutations)
Evasion of apoptosis
Mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis (eg, TP53, BCL2 � follicular B cell lymphoma).
Limitless replicative 
potential
Reactivation of telomerase � maintenance and lengthening of telomeres � prevention of 
chromosome shortening and cell aging.
Sustained 
angiogenesis
� pro-angiogenic factors (eg, VEGF) or � inhibitory factors. Factors may be produced by tumor or 
stromal cells. Vessels can sprout from existing capillaries (neoangiogenesis) or endothelial cells are 
recruited from bone marrow (vasculogenesis). Vessels may be leaky and/or dilated.
Warburg effect
Shift of glucose metabolism away from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis, 
even in the presence of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis provides rapidly dividing cancer cells with the 
carbon needed for synthesis of cellular structures.
Immune evasion in 
cancer
Normally, immune cells can recognize and attack tumor cells. For successful tumorigenesis, tumor 
cells must evade the immune system. Multiple escape mechanisms exist:
 � � MHC class I expression by tumor cells � cytotoxic T cells are unable to recognize tumor 
cells.
 � Tumor cells secrete immunosuppressive factors (eg, TGF-β) and recruit regulatory T cells to 
down regulate immune response.
 � Tumor cells up regulate immune checkpoint molecules, which inhibit immune response.
Tissue invasion
Loss of E-cadherin function � loosening of intercellular junctions � metalloproteinases degrade 
basement membrane and ECM � cells attach to ECM proteins (eg, laminin, fibronectin) � cells 
migrate through degraded ECM (“locomotion”) � vascular dissemination.
Metastasis
Tumor cells or emboli spread via lymphatics or blood � adhesion to endothelium � extravasation 
and homing. Site of metastasis can be predicted by site of 1° tumor, as the target organ is often the 
first-encountered capillary bed. Some cancers show organ tropism (eg, lung cancers commonly 
metastasize to adrenals).

microenvironment) � T-cell dysfunction (exhaustion). Inhibited by antibodies against PD-1 (eg, 
cemiplimab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) or PD-L1 (eg, atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab).
 � CTLA-4 on T cells outcompetes CD28 for B7 on APCs � loss of T-cell costimulatory signal.

Preparation for pharmacology questions is not as straightforward as 
in years past. One major recent change is that the USMLE Step 1 has 
moved away from testing pharmacotherapeutics. That means you will 
generally not be required to identify medications indicated for a specific 
condition. You still need to know mechanisms and important adverse 
effects of key drugs and their major variants. Obscure derivatives are low-
yield. Learn their classic and distinguishing toxicities as well as major 
drug-drug interactions. 
Reviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology 
concepts can be useful while studying pharmacology. The exam has a 
strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents 
as well as on NSAIDs, which are covered throughout the text. Specific 
drug dosages or trade names are generally not testable. The exam may 
use graphs to test various pharmacology content, so make sure you are 
comfortable interpreting them.

Half-life (t1/2)
The time required to change the amount of drug in the body by 1⁄2 during elimination. 
Steady state is a dynamic equilibrium in which drug concentration stays constant (ie, rate of drug 
elimination = rate of drug administration).
In first-order kinetics, a drug infused at a constant rate takes 4–5 half-lives to reach steady state. It 
takes 3.3 half-lives to reach 90% of the steady-state level.

Drug metabolism
Geriatric patients lose phase I first. Patients who are slow acetylators have � adverse effects from 
certain drugs because of � rate of metabolism (eg, isoniazid).
Drugs can be metabolized by either or both phase 1 and phase 2 reactions. These reactions serve

Nicotinic ACh receptors are ligand-gated channels allowing efflux of K+ and influx of Na+ and in 
some cases Ca2+. Two subtypes: NN (found in autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla) and NM (found 
in neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle). 
Muscarinic ACh receptors are G-protein–coupled receptors that usually act through 2nd 
messengers. 5 subtypes: M1–5 found in heart, smooth muscle, brain, exocrine glands, and on sweat 
glands (cholinergic sympathetic).

Autonomic drugs
Release of norepinephrine from a sympathetic nerve ending is modulated by NE itself, acting on 
presyn aptic α2-autoreceptors � negative feedback.
Amphetamines use the NE transporter (NET) to enter the presynaptic terminal, where they utilize 
the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) to enter neurosecretory vesicles. This displaces NE 
from the vesicles. Once NE reaches a concentration threshold within the presynaptic terminal, 
the action of NET is reversed, and NE is expelled into the synaptic cleft, contributing to the 
characteristics and effects of � NE observed in patients taking amphetamines.

A heterogenous mix of epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, law, healthcare 
delivery, patient safety, quality improvement, and more falls under the 
heading of public health sciences. Biostatistics and epidemiology are the 
foundations of evidence-based medicine and are very high yield. Make 
sure you can quickly apply biostatistical equations such as sensitivity, 
specificity, and predictive values in a problem-solving format. Also, 
know how to set up your own 2 × 2 tables, and beware questions that 
switch the columns. Quality improvement and patient safety topics were 
introduced a few years ago on the exam and represent trends in health 
system science. Medical ethics questions often require application of 
principles. Typically, you are presented with a patient scenario and then 
asked how you would respond. In this edition, we provide further details 
on communication skills and patient care given their growing emphasis 
on the exam. Effective communication is essential to the physician-
patient partnership. Physicians must seek opportunities to connect with 
patients, understand their perspectives, express empathy, and form 
shared decisions and realistic goals.

Clinical therapeutic 
trial
Experimental study involving humans. Compares therapeutic benefits of ≥ 2 interventions (eg, 
treatment vs placebo, treatment vs treatment). Study quality improves when clinical trial is 
randomized, controlled, and double-blinded (ie, neither subject nor researcher knows whether 
the subject is in the treatment or control group). Triple-blind refers to additional blinding of the 
researchers analyzing the data.
Crossover clinical trial—compares the effect of a series of ≥ 2 treatments on a subject. Order in 
which subjects receive treatments is randomized. Washout period occurs between treatments. 
Allows subjects to serve as their own controls.
Intention-to-treat analysis—all subjects are analyzed according to their original, randomly 
assigned treatment. No one is excluded. Attempts to avoid bias from attrition, crossover, and 
nonrandom noncompliance, but may dilute the true effects of intervention.
As-treated analysis—all subjects are analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. � 
risk of bias.
Per-protocol analysis—subjects who fail to complete treatment as originally, randomly assigned are 
excluded. � risk of bias.
Clinical trials occur after preclinical studies and consist of five phases (“Can I SWIM?”).
Preclinical
Test drug in lab animals
and in vitro experiments
Phase 0
Initial pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic assessment via
microdosing. Often skipped. 
Very small number of healthy
volunteers or patients
with disease of interest.
Open label. 
Sample
Phase 1
Safety assessment via dose
escalation. Determine
maximum tolerable dose. 
Small number of healthy
volunteers or patients
with disease of interest.
Open label. 
Phase 2
Moderate number of patients with
disease of interest. Randomized,
controlled, anonymized. 
Efcacy assessment (does it
Work?) Provides additional
data on short-term
adverse efects. 
Phase 3
Large number of patients with 
disease of interest. Randomized,
controlled, anonymized. 
Efectiveness assessment via
comparison with current standard of
care/placebo (any Improvement?)  
Phase 4
Provides data on long-tern or
rare adverse efects (can it
stay on the Market?) 
Postmarketing surveillance of
patients with disease of interest.
Open label.
FDA approval
?
?
Off-label drug use
Use of a drug to treat a disease in a form, population group, or dosage that is not specifically 
approved by the FDA. Reasons for off-label use include treatment of an illness with no approved 
pharmacologic treatment or exploring alternative treatments after failure of approved options.
Example: use of tricyclic antidepressants for treating neuropathic/chronic pain.
Bradford Hill criteria
A group of principles that provide limited support for establishing evidence of a causal relationship 
between presumed cause and effect.
Strength
Association does not necessarily imply causation, but the stronger the association, the more 
evidence for causation.
Consistency
Repeated observations of the findings in multiple distinct samples.
Specificity
The more specific the presumed cause is to the effect, the stronger the evidence for causation.
Temporality
The presumed cause precedes the effect by an expected amount of time.
Biological gradient
Greater effect observed with greater exposure to the presumed cause (dose-response relationship).
Plausibility
A conceivable mechanism exists by which the cause may lead to the effect.
Coherence
The presumed cause and effect do not conflict with existing scientific consensus.
Experiment
Empirical evidence supporting the presumed cause and effect (eg, animal studies, in vitro studies).
Analogy
The presumed cause and effect are comparable to a similar, established cause and effect.

Odds ratio
Typically used in case-control 
studies. Represents the odds of 
exposure among cases (a/c) vs odds 
of exposure among controls (b/d).
OR = 1 � odds of exposure are 
equal in cases and controls.
OR > 1 � odds of exposure are 
greater in cases.
OR < 1 � odds of exposure are 
greater in controls.
If in a case-control study, 20/30 patients 
with lung cancer and 5/25 healthy 
individuals report smoking, the OR is 
8; so the patients with lung cancer are 
8 times more likely to have a history of 
smoking.

Relative risk
Typically used in cohort studies. 
Risk of developing disease in the 
exposed group divided by risk in 
the unexposed group. 
RR = 1 � no association between 
exposure and disease.
RR > 1 � exposure associated with 
� disease occurrence. 
RR < 1 � exposure associated with 
� disease occurrence.
If 5/10 people exposed to radiation are 
diagnosed with cancer, and 1/10 people 
not exposed to radiation are diagnosed 
with cancer, the RR is 5; so people 
exposed to radiation have a 5 times 
greater risk of developing cancer.

The proportion of risk reduction 
attributable to the intervention 
(ARI) as compared to a control 
(ARC).
If 2% of patients who receive a flu 
shot develop the flu, while 8% of 
unvaccinated patients develop the flu, 
then RR = 2/8 = 0.25, and RRR = 0.75.
RRR = (ARC – ART)
  
       ARC 
Attributable 
risk
The difference in risk between 
exposed and unexposed groups.
If risk of lung cancer in people who 
smoke is 21% and risk in people who 
don’t smoke is 1%, then the attributable 
risk is 20%.

Bias and study errors
TyPE
dEFINITIoN
EXAmPLES
STRATEgIES To REdUCE BIAS
Recruiting participants
Selection bias 
Nonrandom sampling 
or treatment allocation 
of subjects such that 
study population is not 
representative of target 
population
Most commonly a sampling 
bias
Convenience sampling—
patients are enrolled on basis 
of ease of contact
Berkson bias—cases and/
or controls selected from 
hospitals (bedside bias) are 
less healthy and have different 
exposures
Attrition bias—participants lost 
to follow up have a different 
prognosis than those who 
complete the study
Randomization (creates groups 
with similar distributions 
of known and unknown 
variables)
Ensure the choice of the right 
comparison/reference group
Performing study
Recall bias 
Awareness of disorder alters 
recall by subjects; common in 
retrospective studies
Patients with disease recall 
exposure after learning of 
similar cases
Decrease time from exposure 
to follow-up; use medical 
records as sources
Measurement bias
Information is gathered in a 
systemically distorted manner
Using a faulty automatic 
sphygmomanometer
Hawthorne effect—participants 
change behavior upon 
awareness of being observed
Use objective, standardized, 
and previously tested methods 
of data collection that are 
planned ahead of time 
Use placebo group
Procedure bias
Subjects in different groups are 
not treated the same
Patients in treatment group 
spend more time in highly 
specialized hospital units
Blinding (masking) and 
use of placebo reduce 
influence of participants and 
researchers on procedures and 
interpretation of outcomes 
as neither are aware of group 
assignments
Observer-expectancy 
bias
Researcher’s belief in the 
efficacy of a treatment changes 
the outcome of that treatment 
(also called Pygmalion effect)
An observer expecting 
treatment group to show signs 
of recovery is more likely to 
document positive outcomes
Interpreting results
Lead-time bias
Early detection interpreted as 
� survival, but the disease 
course has not changed
Breast cancer diagnosed early 
by mammography may 
appear to exaggerate survival 
time because patients are 
known to have the cancer for 
longer
Measure “back-end” survival 
(adjust survival according to 
the severity of disease at the 
time of diagnosis)
Length-time bias
Screening test detects diseases 
with long latency period, 
while those with shorter 
latency period become 
symptomatic earlier
A slowly progressive cancer 
is more likely detected by a 
screening test than a rapidly 
progressive cancer
A randomized controlled trial 
assigning subjects to the 
screening program or to no 
screening

Effect modification
Exposure leads to different 
outcomes in subgroups 
stratified by factor
True association exists
A study among women using 
OCPs showed significant risk 
of DVT, but when these data 
were stratified by smoking 
habits, there was a very strong 
association between smoking 
and OCP use with DVT, 
but there was no association

Statistical distribution
Measures of central 
tendency
Mean = (sum of values)/(total number of values).
Most affected by outliers (extreme values).
Median = middle value of a list of data sorted 
from least to greatest.
If there is an even number of values, the median 
will be the average of the middle two values.
Mode = most common value.
Least affected by outliers.
Measures of 
dispersion
Standard deviation = how much variability 
exists in a set of values, around the mean of 
these values.
Standard error = an estimate of how much 
variability exists in a (theoretical) set of sample 
means around the true population mean.
σ = SD; n = sample size.
Variance = (SD)2.
SE = σ/√n.
SE � as n �.
Normal distribution
Gaussian, also called bell-shaped.
Mean = median = mode. 
For normal distribution, mean is the best

Null hypothesis
Also called H0. Hypothesis of no difference or relationship (eg, there is no association between the

the disease and the risk factor in the population).
P value
Probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as those observed during the test, assuming 
that H0 is correct. Commonly accepted as 0.05 (< 5% of results occur due to chance).

Type I error (α)
Stating that there is an effect or difference when 
none exists (H0 incorrectly rejected in favor of 
H1). 
α is the probability of making a type I error 
(usually 0.05 is chosen). If P < α, then 
assuming H0 is true, the probability of 
obtaining the test results would be less than 
the probability of making a type I error. H0 is 
therefore rejected as false.
Statistical significance ≠ clinical significance.
Also called false-positive error.
1st time boy cries wolf, the town believes there 
is a wolf, but there is not (false positive).
You can never “prove” H1, but you can reject the 
H0 as being very unlikely.
Type II error (β)
Stating that there is not an effect or difference 
when one exists (H0 is not rejected when it is 
in fact false). 
β is the probability of making a type II error. β is 
related to statistical power (1 – β), which is the 
probability of rejecting H0 when it is false.

Generally, when type I error increases, type II 
error decreases.
Statistical vs clinical 
significance
Statistical significance—defined by the likelihood of study results being due to chance. If there is a 
high statistical significance, then there is a low probability that the results are due to chance.
Clinical significance—measure of effect on treatment outcomes. An intervention with high clinical 
significance is likely to have a large impact on patient outcomes/measures.
Some studies have a very high statistical significance, but the proposed intervention may not have 
any clinical impact/significance.

Core ethical principles
Autonomy
Obligation to respect patients as individuals (truth-telling, confidentiality), to create conditions 
necessary for autonomous choice (informed consent), and to honor their preference in accepting 
or not accepting medical care.
Beneficence
Physicians have a special ethical (fiduciary) duty to act in the patient’s best interest. May conflict 
with autonomy (an informed patient has the right to decide) or what is best for society (eg, 
mandatory TB treatment). Traditionally, patient interest supersedes.
Principle of double effect—facilitating comfort is prioritized over potential side effects (eg, 
respiratory depression with opioid use) for patients receiving end-of-life care.
Nonmaleficence
“Do no harm.” Must be balanced against beneficence; if the benefits outweigh the risks, a patient 
may make an informed decision to proceed (most surgeries and medications fall into this category).
Justice
To treat persons fairly and equitably. This does not always imply equally (eg, triage).
Decision-making 
capacity
Physician must determine whether the patient is 
psychologically and legally capable of making 
a particular healthcare decision. 
Note that decisions made with capacity cannot be 
revoked simply if the patient later loses capacity. 
Intellectual disabilities and mental illnesses 
are not exclusion criteria unless the patient’s 
condition presently impairs their ability to 
make healthcare decisions. 
Capacity is determined by a physician for a 
specific healthcare-related decision (eg, to 
refuse medical care). 
Competency is determined by a judge and 
usually refers to more global categories of 
decision-making (eg, legally unable to make 
any healthcare-related decision). 
Four major components of decision-making:
 � Understanding (what do you know about 
your condition/proposed procedure/
treatment?)
 � Appreciation (what does your condition 
mean to you? why do you think your doctor 
is recommending this course of treatment?)
 � Reasoning (how are you weighing your 
options?)
 � Expressing a choice (what would you like 
to do?)
Public HealtH ScienceS 
` 
PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES—ETHICS
SectiOn ii
268
Informed consent
A process (not just a document/signature) that 
requires:
 � Disclosure: discussion of pertinent 
information, including risks/benefits (using 
medical interpreter, if needed) 
 � Understanding: ability to comprehend
 � Capacity: ability to reason and make one’s 
own decisions (distinct from competence, a 
legal determination)
 � Voluntariness: freedom from coercion and 
manipulation
Patients must have a comprehensive 
understanding of their diagnosis and the risks/
benefits of proposed treatment and alternative 
options, including no treatment.
Patients must be informed of their right to 
revoke written consent at any time, even orally.
Exceptions to informed consent (WIPE it away):
 � Waiver—patient explicitly relinquishes the 
right of informed consent
 � Legally Incompetent—patient lacks decision-
making capacity (obtain consent from legal 
surrogate) 
 � Therapeutic Privilege—withholding 
information when disclosure would severely 
harm the patient or undermine informed 
decision-making capacity 
 � Emergency situation—implied consent may 
apply
Consent for minors
A minor is generally any person < 18 years old. 
Parental consent laws in relation to healthcare 
vary by state. In general, parental consent 
should be obtained, but exceptions exist for 
emergency treatment (eg, blood transfusions) 
or if minor is legally emancipated (eg, married, 
self-supporting, or in the military). 
Situations in which parental consent is usually 
not required:
 � Sex (contraception, STIs, prenatal care—
usually not abortion) 
 � Drugs (substance use disorder treatment)
 � Rock and roll (emergency/trauma) 
Physicians should always encourage healthy 
minor-guardian communication.
Physician should seek a minor’s assent 
(agreement of someone unable to legally 
consent) even if their consent is not required.

Instructions given by a patient in anticipation of the need for a medical decision. Details vary per 
state law.
Oral advance directive
Incapacitated patient’s prior oral statements commonly used as guide. Problems arise from variance 
in interpretation. If patient was informed, directive was specific, patient made a choice, and 
decision was repeated over time to multiple people, then the oral directive is more valid.
Written advance 
directive
Delineates specific healthcare interventions that patient anticipates accepting or rejecting during 
treatment for a critical or life-threatening illness. A living will is an example.
Medical power of 
attorney
Patient designates an agent to make medical decisions in the event that the patient loses decision-
making capacity. Patient may also specify decisions in clinical situations. Can be revoked by 
patient if decision-making capacity is intact. More flexible than a living will.
Do not resuscitate 
order
DNR order prohibits cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Patient may still consider other life-
sustaining measures (eg, intubation, feeding tube, chemotherapy).

Ventilator-assisted life 
support
Ideally, discussions with patients occur before ventilator support is necessary. However, information 
about patient preferences may be absent at the time patients require this intervention to survive. 
Medical decision-making frequently relies on surrogate decision-makers (patient identified or 
legally appointed) when discussing the continuation or withdrawal of ventilatory support, focusing 
on both the prognosis of the condition and the believed wishes of the patient. 
If surrogates indicate patient would not have wanted to receive life support with ventilation � 
withhold or withdraw life support regardless of what the surrogate prefers.
If the decision is made to withhold or withdraw life support, involve palliative care, chaplain services, 
and the primary care physician in medical discussions with the family and provide emotional support.
Surrogate decision-
maker
If a patient loses decision-making capacity and has not prepared an advance directive, individuals 
(surrogates) who know the patient must determine what the patient would have done. Priority 
of surrogates: spouse � adult children � parents � adult siblings � other relatives (the spouse 
chips in).
Confidentiality
Confidentiality respects patient privacy and autonomy. If the patient is incapacitated or the 
situation is emergent, disclosing information to family and friends should be guided by 
professional judgment of patient’s best interest. The patient may voluntarily waive the right to 
confidentiality (eg, insurance company request).
General principles for exceptions to confidentiality:
 � Potential physical harm to self or others is serious and imminent
 � Alternative means to warn or protect those at risk is not possible
 � Steps can be taken to prevent harm
Examples of exceptions to patient confidentiality (many are state specific) include the following 
(“The physician’s good judgment SAVED the day”):
 � Patients with Suicidal/homicidal ideation
 � Abuse (children, older adults, and/or prisoners)
 � Duty to protect—state-specific laws that sometimes allow physician to inform or somehow 
protect potential Victim from harm
 � Patients with Epilepsy and other impaired automobile drivers
 � Reportable Diseases (eg, STIs, hepatitis, food poisoning); physicians may have a duty to warn 
public officials, who will then notify people at risk. Dangerous communicable diseases, such as 
TB or Ebola, may require involuntary treatment.
Accepting gifts from 
patients
A complex subject without definitive regulations. Some argue that the patient-physician 
relationship is strengthened through accepting a gift from a patient, while others argue that 
negative consequences outweigh the benefits of accepting any gift.
In practice, patients often present items such as cards, baked goods, and inexpensive gifts to 
physicians. The physician’s decision to accept or decline is based on an individual assessment of 
whether or not the risk of harm outweighs the potential benefit.
 � Physicians should not accept gifts that are inappropriately large or valuable.
 � Gifts should not be accepted if the physician identifies that the gift could detrimentally affect 
patient care.
 � Gifts that may cause emotional or financial stress for the patient should not be accepted.
If a gift violates any of the guidelines above, the best practice is to thank the patient for offering 
a kind gift, but politely indicate that it must be declined. During this conversation it should be 
emphasized that the incident does not influence the physician-patient relationship in any way.

Patient-centered interviewing techniques
Introduction
Introduce yourself and ask the patient their name and how they would like to be addressed. Address 
the patient by the name and pronouns given. Avoid making gender assumptions. Sit at eye level 
near the patient.
Agenda setting
Identify concerns and set goals by developing joint agenda between the physician and the patient.
Reflection
Actively listen and synthesize information offered by the patient, particularly with respect to 
primary concern(s).
Validation
Legitimize or affirm the patient’s perspectives.
Recapitulation
Summarize what the patient has said so far to ensure correct interpretation.
Facilitation
Encourage the patient to speak freely without guiding responses or leading questions. Allow the 
patient to ask questions throughout the encounter.
Establishing rapport
PEARLS
Partnership
Work together with patient to identify primary concerns and develop preferred solutions.
Empathy
Acknowledge the emotions displayed and demonstrate understanding of why the patient is feeling 
that way.
Apology
Take personal responsibility when appropriate.
Respect
Commend the patient for coming in to discuss a problem, pushing through challenging 
circumstances, keeping a positive attitude, or other constructive behaviors.
Legitimization
Assure patient that emotional responses are understandable or common.
Support
Reassure patient that you will work together through difficult times and offer appropriate resources.
Delivering bad news
SPIKES
Setting
Offer in advance for the patient to bring support. Eliminate distractions, ensure privacy, and sit 
down with the patient to talk.
Perception
Determine the patient’s understanding and expectations of the situation.
Invitation
Obtain the patient’s permission to disclose the news and what level of detail is desired.
Knowledge
Share the information in small pieces without medical jargon, allowing time to process. Assess the 
patient’s understanding.
Emotions
Acknowledge the patient’s emotions, and provide opportunity to express them. Listen and offer 
empathetic responses.
Strategy
If the patient feels ready, discuss treatment options and goals of care. Offer an agenda for the next 
appointment. Giving control to the patient may be empowering. Ask how they feel a problem 
might be solved and what they would like to do about the plan of action.

Gender- and sexuality-
inclusive history 
taking
Avoid making assumptions about sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and 
behavior (eg, a patient who identifies as heterosexual may engage in same-sex sexual activity).
Use gender-neutral terms (eg, refer to a patient’s “partner” rather than assuming a spouse’s gender).
A patient’s sex assigned at birth and gender identity may differ.
Consider stating what pronouns you use when you introduce yourself (eg, “I’m Dr. Smith, and I use 
she/her pronouns”) and asking patients how they would like to be addressed.
Reassure them about the confidentiality of their appointments and be sensitive to the fact that 
patients may not be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity to others in their life.
Do not bring up gender or sexuality if it is not relevant to the visit (eg, a gender-nonconforming 
patient seeking care for a hand laceration).
Cultural formulation 
interview
Identify the problem through the patient’s perspective. Ask the patient to describe the problem in 
their own words, or how the patient would describe the problem to their family and friends.
Identify cultural perceptions of factors leading to a problem. Ask the patient to explain why they 
think they are experiencing their problem.
Identify how the patient’s background influences their problem. Ask the patient about what makes 
their problem better or worse. Investigate roles of family, community, and spirituality.
Identify how culture may impact current and future interventions. Ask the patient if they have any 
concerns about the current plan of treatment and if they have any suggestions. If they do not want 
to follow medical advice, investigate if there is a way to combine their plans with the standard 
medical regimen.
Identify possible barriers to care based on culture. Ask the patient if there is anything that would 
prevent them from seeking care in a standard medical institution. Probe for explanations and 
what may increase the chance of maintaining a good patient-physician relationship.
Motivational 
interviewing
Counseling technique to facilitate behavior modification by helping patients resolve ambivalence 
about change. Useful for many conditions (eg, nicotine dependence, obesity). Helpful when 
patient has some desire to change, but it does not require that the patient be committed to making 
the change. May involve asking patients to examine how their behavior interferes with their life 
or why they might want to change it. Assess barriers (eg, food access, untreated trauma) that may 
make behavior change difficult.
Assessing a patient’s readiness for change is also important for guiding physician-suggested goals. 
These goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time bound (SMART).
Trauma-informed care
Patients with history of psychological trauma should receive thorough behavioral health screenings. 
Regularly assess mood, substance use, social supports, and suicide risk.
Focus assessments on trauma-related symptoms that interfere with social and occupational 
function. Do not probe into details of the incident.
Always be empathetic. Do not ask invasive questions requiring the patient to describe trauma in 
detail. Ask permission prior to discussion.
Before the physical exam, reassure patients that they may signal to end it immediately if they 
experience too much physical or emotional discomfort. Offer the presence of additional staff for 
support. Psychological counseling may be indicated. Follow-up counseling is offered (or advised) 
as appropriate.

Challenging patient and ethical 
scenarios
The most appropriate response is usually one that acknowledges the issues, validates 
emotions, and is open ended, empathetic, and patient centered. It often honors one 
or more of the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. 
Appropriate responses are respectful of patients and other members of the healthcare 
team.
SITUATIoN
APPRoPRIATE RESPoNSE
Patient does not follow the medical 
plan.
Determine whether there are financial, logistical, or other obstacles preventing the 
patient’s adherence. Do not coerce the patient into adhering or refer the patient to 
another physician. Schedule regular follow-up visits to track patient progress.
Patient desires an unnecessary 
procedure.
Attempt to understand why the patient wants the procedure and address underlying 
concerns. Do not refuse to see the patient or refer to another physician. Avoid 
performing unnecessary procedures.
Patient has difficulty taking 
medications.
Determine what factors are involved in the patient’s difficulties. If comprehension or 
memory are issues, use techniques such as providing written instructions, using the 
teach-back method, or simplifying treatment regimens.
Family members ask for information 
about patient’s prognosis.
Avoid discussing issues with relatives without the patient’s permission.
A patient’s family member asks you 
not to disclose the results of a test 
if the prognosis is poor because 
the patient will be “unable to 
handle it.”
Explore why the family member believes this would be detrimental, including 
possible cultural factors. Explain that if the patient would like to know information 
concerning care, it will not be withheld. However, if you believe the patient might 
seriously harm self or others if informed, you may invoke therapeutic privilege and 
withhold the information.
A 17-year-old is pregnant and 
requests an abortion.
Many states require parental notification or consent for minors for an abortion. Unless 
there are specific medical risks associated with pregnancy, a physician should not 
sway the patient’s decision for, or against, an elective abortion (regardless of patient’s 
age or fetal condition). Discuss options for terminating the pregnancy and refer to 
abortion care, if needed.
A 15-year-old is pregnant and wants 
to raise the child. The patient’s 
parents want you to tell the patient 
to give the child up for adoption.
The patient retains the right to make decisions regarding the child, even if the patient’s 
parents disagree. Provide information to the teenager about the practical aspects 
of caring for a baby. Discuss options for terminating the pregnancy, if requested. 
Encourage discussion between the patient and parents to reach the best decision.
A terminally ill patient requests 
physician-assisted dying.
The overwhelming majority of states prohibit most forms of physician-assisted dying. 
Physicians may, however, prescribe medically appropriate analgesics even if they 
potentially shorten the patient’s life.
Patient is suicidal.
Assess the seriousness of the threat. If patient is actively suicidal with a plan, suggest 
remaining in the hospital voluntarily; patient may be hospitalized involuntarily if needed.
Patient states that you are attractive 
and asks if you would go on a date.
Use a chaperone if necessary. Romantic relationships with patients are never 
appropriate. Set firm professional boundaries with direct communication. Transition 
care to another physician if necessary.
A woman who had a mastectomy 
says she now feels “ugly.”
Find out why the patient feels this way. Do not offer falsely reassuring statements (eg, 
“You still look good”).
Patient is angry about the long time 
spent in the waiting room.
Acknowledge the patient’s anger, but do not take a patient’s anger personally. Thank 
the patient for being patient and apologize for any inconvenience. Stay away from 
efforts to explain the delay.
Patient is upset with treatment 
received from another physician.
Suggest that the patient speak directly to that physician regarding the concern. If the 
problem is with a member of the office staff, reassure the patient you will speak to 
that person.

An invasive test is performed on the 
wrong patient.
Regardless of the outcome, a physician is ethically obligated to inform a patient that a 
mistake has been made.
A patient requires a treatment not 
covered by insurance.
Discuss all treatment options with patients, even if some are not covered by their 
insurance companies. Inform patient of financial assistance programs.
A 7-year-old boy loses a sister to 
cancer and now feels responsible.
At ages 5–7, children begin to understand that death is permanent, all life functions 
end completely at death, and everything that is alive eventually dies. Provide a direct, 
concrete description of his sister’s death. Avoid clichés and euphemisms. Reassure the 
boy that he is not responsible. Identify and normalize fears and feelings. Encourage 
play and healthy coping behaviors (eg, remembering her in his own way).
Patient is victim of intimate partner 
violence.
Ask if patient is safe and help devise an emergency plan if there isn’t one. Ask patient 
direct, open-ended questions about exam findings and summarize patient’s answers 
back to them. Ask if patient has any questions. Do not necessarily pressure patient to 
leave a partner or disclose the incident to the authorities (unless required by state law).
Patient wants to try alternative or 
holistic medicine.
Explore any underlying reasons with the patient in a supportive, nonjudgmental manner. 
Advise the patient of known benefits and risks of treatment, including adverse effects, 
contraindications, and medication interactions. Consider referral to an appropriate 
complementary or alternative medicine provider.
Physician colleague presents to 
work impaired.
This presents a potential risk to patient safety. You have an ethical and usually a legal 
obligation to report impaired colleagues so they can cease patient care and receive 
appropriate assistance in a timely manner. Seek guidance in reporting as procedures 
and applicable law vary by institution and state.
Patient’s family insists on 
maintaining life support after brain 
death has occurred, citing patient’s 
movements when touched.
Gently explain to family that there is no chance of recovery, and that brain death is 
equivalent to death. Movement is due to spinal arc reflex and is not voluntary. Bring 
case to appropriate ethics board regarding futility of care and withdrawal of life 
support.
A pharmaceutical company offers 
you a sponsorship in exchange for 
advertising its new drug.
Reject this offer. Generally, decline gifts and sponsorships to avoid any conflict of 
interest. The AMA Code of Ethics does make exceptions for gifts directly benefitting 
patients; special funding for medical education of students, residents, fellows; grants 
whose recipients are chosen by independent institutional criteria; and funds that are 
distributed without attribution to sponsors.
Patient requests a nonemergent 
procedure that is against your 
personal or religious beliefs.
Provide accurate and unbiased information so patients can make an informed decision. 
In a neutral, nonjudgmental manner, explain to the patient that you do not perform 
the procedure but offer to refer to another physician.
Mother and 15-year-old daughter 
are unresponsive and bleeding 
heavily, but father refuses 
transfusion because they are 
Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Transfuse daughter, but do not transfuse mother. Emergent care can be refused by the 
healthcare proxy for an adult, particularly when patient preferences are known or 
reasonably inferred, but not for a minor based solely on faith.
A dependent patient presents 
with injuries inconsistent with 
caretaker’s story.
Document detailed history and physical. If possible and appropriate, interview the 
patient alone. Provide any necessary medical care. If suspicion remains, contact 
the appropriate agencies or authorities (eg, child or adult protective services) for an 
evaluation. Inform the caretaker of your obligation to report. Physicians are required 
by law to report any reasonable suspicion of abuse, neglect, or endangerment.
A pediatrician recommends standard 
vaccinations for a patient, but the 
child’s parent refuses.
Address any concerns the parent has. Explain the risks and benefits of vaccinations 
and why they are recommended. Do not administer routine vaccinations without the 
parent’s consent.

Communicating 
with patients with 
disabilities
Patients may identify with person-first (ie, “a person with a disability”) or identity-first (ie, “a 
disabled person”) language. Ask patients what terms they use.
Under most circumstances, talk directly to the patient. Do not assume that nonverbal patients do 
not understand. Accompanying caregivers can add information to any discussion as needed.
Ask if assistance is desired rather than assuming the patient cannot do something alone. Most 
people, including people with disabilities, value their independence.
For patients with speech difficulties, provide extra time for the interview. If their speech is difficult 
to understand, consider asking them to write down a few words or ask them to rephrase their 
sentence. Repeat what they said to ensure you understood it correctly.
For patients with a cognitive impairment, use concrete, specific language. Ask simple, direct 
questions. Eliminate background noise and distractions. Do not assume the patient can read. 
Adjust to how the patient understands best (eg, use hand gestures or ask them to demonstrate a task).
Ask patients who are deaf or hard of hearing their preferred mode of communication. Use light 
touch or waving to get their attention. For patients who prefer to speak and lipread, eliminate 
background noise, face the patient, and do not change your mode of speaking. Consider using an 
interpreter when necessary.
As with other parts of a medical history, do not bring up a disability if it is not relevant to a visit (eg, 
a patient in a wheelchair with an ear infection). Do not skip relevant parts of the physical exam 
even if the disability makes the exam challenging.
Use of interpreters
Visits with a patient who speaks little English should utilize a professionally trained medical 
interpreter unless the physician is conversationally fluent in the patient’s preferred language. If an 
interpreter is unavailable in person, interpretation services may be provided by telephone or video 
call. If the patient prefers to utilize a family member, this should be recorded in the chart.
Do not assume that a patient is a poor English speaker because of name, skin tone, or accent. Ask 
the patient what language is preferred.
The physician should make eye contact with the patient and speak to them directly, without use of 
third-person statements such as “tell him.”
Allow extra time for the interview, and ask one question at a time.
For in-person spoken language interpretation, the interpreter should ideally be next to or slightly 
behind the patient. For sign language interpretation, the interpreter should be next to or slightly 
behind the physician.
In cases of emergency, facilitate communication by any tools available (eg, friends, family, sketches, 
interpreter apps) even though they do not comprise standard procedure otherwise.

Bundled payment
Healthcare organization receives a set amount per service, regardless of ultimate cost, to be divided 
among all providers and facilities involved.
Capitation
Physicians receive a set amount per patient assigned to them per period of time, regardless of how 
much the patient uses the healthcare system. Used by some HMOs.
Discounted fee-for-
service
Insurer and/or patient pays for each individual service at a discounted rate predetermined by 
providers and payers (eg, PPOs).
Fee-for-service
Insurer and/or patient pays for each individual service.
Global payment
Insurer and/or patient pays for all expenses associated with a single incident of care with a single 
payment. Most commonly used during elective surgeries, as it covers the cost of surgery as well as 
the necessary pre- and postoperative visits.

Medicare and Medicaid—federal social 
healthcare programs that originated from 
amendments to the Social Security Act. 
Medicare is available to patients ≥ 65 years old, 
< 65 with certain disabilities, and those with 
end-stage renal disease.
Medicaid is joint federal and state health 
assistance for people with limited income and/
or resources.
MedicarE is for Elderly. 
MedicaiD is for Disadvantaged. 
The 4 parts of Medicare: 
 � Part A: hospital Admissions, including

 � Part B: Basic medical bills (eg, physician 
fees, diagnostic testing) 
 � Part C: (parts A + B = Combo) delivered by 
approved private companies 
 � Part D: prescription Drugs
Palliative care
Medical care aiming to provide comfort, relieve suffering, and improve quality of life in patients 
with serious illness regardless of their diagnosis or prognosis. Often concurrent with curative or 
life-prolonging treatment.
Delivered by interdisciplinary team (eg, physicians, nurses, social workers) in hospitals, outpatient 
clinics, or at home.
Hospice care (end-of-life care)—form of palliative care for patients with prognosis ≤ 6 months when 
curative or life-prolonging treatment is no longer beneficial.

Embryology, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. As 
you progress through each Organ System, refer back to information in 
the previous subsections to organize these basic science subsections into a 
“vertically integrated” framework for learning. Below is some general advice 
for studying the organ systems by these subsections.
Embryology
Relevant embryology is included in each organ system subsection. Embryology 
tends to correspond well with the relevant anatomy, especially with regard to 
congenital malformations.
Anatomy
Several topics fall under this heading, including gross anatomy, histology, 
and neuroanatomy. Do not memorize all the small details; however, do 
not ignore anatomy altogether. Review what you have already learned 
and what you wish you had learned. Many questions require two or more 
steps. The first step is to identify a structure on anatomic cross section, 
electron micrograph, or photomicrograph. The second step may require an 
understanding of the clinical significance of the structure.
While studying, emphasize clinically relevant material. For example, be 
familiar with gross anatomy and radiologic anatomy  related to specific diseases 
(eg, Pancoast tumor, Horner syndrome), traumatic injuries (eg, fractures, 
sensory and motor nerve deficits), procedures (eg, lumbar puncture), and 
common surgeries (eg, cholecystectomy). There are also many questions on 
the exam involving x-rays, CT scans, and neuro MRI scans. Many students 
suggest browsing through a general radiology atlas, pathology atlas, and 
histology atlas. Focus on learning basic anatomy at key levels in the body 
(eg,  sagittal brain MRI; axial CT of the midthorax, abdomen, and pelvis). 
Basic neuroanatomy (especially pathways, blood supply, and functional 
anatomy), associated neuropathology, and neurophysiology have good 
yield. Please note that many of the photographic images in this book are for 
illustrative purposes and are not necessarily reflective of Step 1 emphasis.
Physiology
The portion of the examination dealing with physiology is broad and concept 
oriented and thus does not lend itself as well to fact-based review. Diagrams 
are often the best study aids, especially given the increasing number of 
questions requiring the interpretation of diagrams. Learn to apply basic 
physiologic relationships in a variety of ways (eg, the Fick equation, clearance 
equations). You are seldom asked to perform complex calculations. Hormones 
HIGH-YIELD ORGAN SYSTEMS
SECTION III

are the focus of many questions; learn where and how they are synthesized, 
their regulatory mechanisms and sites of action.
A large portion of the physiology tested on the USMLE Step 1 is clinically 
relevant and involves understanding physiologic changes associated with 
pathologic processes (eg, changes in pulmonary function with COPD). 
Thus, it is worthwhile to review the physiologic changes that are found with 
common pathologies of the major organ systems (eg, heart, lungs, kidneys, 
GI tract) and endocrine glands.
Pathology
Questions dealing with this discipline are difficult to prepare for because 
of the sheer volume of material involved. Review the basic principles and 
hallmark characteristics of the key diseases. Given the clinical orientation of 
Step 1, it is no longer sufficient to know only the “buzzword” associations of 
certain diseases (eg, café-au-lait macules and neurofibromatosis); you must 
also recognize the clinical descriptions of these high-yield physical exam 
findings.
Given the clinical slant of the USMLE Step 1, it is also important to 
review the classic presenting signs and symptoms of diseases as well as 
their associated laboratory findings. Delve into the signs, symptoms, and 
pathophysiology of major diseases that have a high prevalence in the United 
States (eg, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, 
ischemic heart disease, infectious disease). Be prepared to think one step 
beyond the simple diagnosis to treatment or complications. 
The examination includes a number of color photomicrographs and 
photographs of gross specimens that are presented in the setting of a brief 
clinical history. However, read the question and the choices carefully before 
looking at the illustration, because the history will help you identify the 
pathologic process. Flip through an illustrated pathology textbook, color 
atlases, and appropriate Web sites in order to look at the pictures in the days 
before the exam. Pay attention to potential clues such as age, sex, ethnicity, 
occupation, recent activities and exposures, and specialized lab tests.
Pharmacology
Preparation for questions on pharmacology is straightforward. Learning 
all the key drugs and their characteristics (eg, mechanisms, clinical use, 
and important adverse effects) is high yield. Focus on understanding the 
prototype drugs in each class. Avoid memorizing obscure derivatives. Learn 
the “classic” and distinguishing toxicities of the major drugs. Do not bother 
with drug dosages or brand names. Reviewing associated biochemistry, 
physiology, and microbiology can be useful while studying pharmacology. 
There is a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular 
agents as well as NSAIDs. Much of the material is clinically relevant. Newer 
drugs on the market are also fair game.

The cardiovascular system is one of the highest yield areas for the 
boards and, for some students, may be the most challenging. Focusing 
on understanding the mechanisms instead of memorizing the details 
can make a big difference. Pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and 
heart failure, mechanism of action of drugs (particularly, physiology 
interactions) and their adverse effects, ECGs of heart blocks, the cardiac 
cycle, and the Starling curve are some of the more high-yield topics. 
Differentiating between systolic and diastolic dysfunction is also very 
important. Heart murmurs and maneuvers that affect these murmurs 
have also been high yield and may be asked in a multimedia format.

Heart morphogenesis
First functional organ in vertebrate embryos; beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.
Cardiac looping
Primary heart tube loops to establish left-right 
polarity; begins in week 4 of development.
Defect in left-right dynein (involved in left-right 
asymmetry) can lead to dextrocardia, as seen 
in Kartagener syndrome.
Septation of the chambers
Atria
 Septum primum grows toward endocardial 
cushions, narrowing ostium primum.
 Ostium secundum forms in septum primum 
due to cell death (ostium primum regresses).
 Septum secundum develops on the right 
side of septum primum, as ostium secundum 
maintains right-to-left shunt.
  Septum secundum expands and covers most 
of ostium secundum. The residual foramen is 
the foramen ovale.
  Remaining portion of septum primum forms 
the one-way valve of the foramen ovale. 
6.  Septum primum closes against septum 
secundum, sealing the foramen ovale soon 
after birth because of � LA pressure and � RA 
pressure.
7.  Septum secundum and septum primum fuse 
during infancy/early childhood, forming the 
atrial septum.
Patent foramen ovale—caused by failure of 
septum primum and septum secundum 
to fuse after birth; most are left untreated. 
Can lead to paradoxical emboli (venous 
thromboemboli entering the systemic arterial 
circulation through right-to-left shunt) as can 
occur in atrial septal defect (ASD).

Fetal circulation
Blood in umbilical vein has a Po2 of ≈ 30 mm Hg 
and is ≈ 80% saturated with O2. Umbilical 
arteries have low O2 saturation.
3 important shunts:
  Blood entering fetus through the 
umbilical vein is conducted via the ductus 
venosus into the IVC, bypassing hepatic 
circulation.
  Most of the highly oxygenated blood 
reaching the heart via the IVC is directed 
through the foramen ovale into the left 
atrium.
 Deoxygenated blood from the SVC passes 
through the RA � RV � main pulmonary 
artery � ductus arteriosus � descending 
aorta; shunt is due to high fetal pulmonary 
artery resistance.
At birth, infant takes a breath � � resistance 
in pulmonary vasculature � � left atrial 
pressure vs right atrial pressure� foramen 
ovale closes (now called fossa ovalis); � in O2 
(from respiration) and � in prostaglandins

arteriosus.
NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin, ibuprofen) or 
acetaminophen help close the patent ductus 
arteriosus � ligamentum arteriosum (remnant 
of ductus arteriosus). “Endomethacin” ends

LA is the most posterior part of the heart A  ; 
enlargement of the LA (eg, in mitral stenosis) 
can lead to compression of the esophagus

nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve, causing 
hoarseness (Ortner syndrome).
RV is the most anterior part of the heart and

posteromedial papillary muscle.
RCA supplies AV node and SA node. Infarct 
may cause nodal dysfunction (bradycardia 
or heart block). Right (acute) marginal artery 
supplies RV.
Dominance:
 � Right-dominant circulation (most common) 
= PDA arises from RCA
 � Left-dominant circulation = PDA arises 
from LCX
 � Codominant circulation = PDA arises from 
both LCX and RCA
Coronary blood flow to LV and interventricular

  Rapid filling—period just after mitral 
valve opening 
  Reduced filling—period just before mitral 
valve closing
Heart sounds:
S1—mitral and tricuspid valve closure. Loudest 
at mitral area.
S2—aortic and pulmonary valve closure. 
Loudest at left upper sternal border.
S3—in early diastole during rapid ventricular 
filling phase. Best heard at apex with patient 
in left lateral decubitus position. Associated 
with � filling pressures (eg, MR, AR, HF, 
thyrotoxicosis) and more common in dilated 
ventricles (but can be normal in children, 
young adults, athletes, and pregnancy). 
Turbulence caused by blood from LA mixing 
with � ESV.
S4—in late diastole (“atrial kick”). Turbulence 
caused by blood entering stiffened LV. Best 
heard at apex with patient in left lateral 
decubitus position. High atrial pressure. 
Associated with ventricular noncompliance (eg, 
hypertrophy). Considered abnormal if palpable. 
Common in older adults.
Jugular venous pulse (JVP):
a wave—atrial contraction. Prominent in AV 
dissociation (cannon a wave), absent in atrial 
fibrillation.
c wave—RV contraction (closed tricuspid valve 
bulging into atrium).
x descent—atrial relaxation and downward 
displacement of closed tricuspid valve during 
rapid ventricular ejection phase. Reduced or 
absent in tricuspid regurgitation and right HF 
because pressure gradients are reduced.
v wave—� RA pressure due to � volume against 
closed tricuspid valve.
y descent—RA emptying into RV. Prominent 
in constrictive pericarditis, absent in cardiac 
tamponade.

Myocardial action 
potential
Phase 0 = rapid upstroke and depolarization—
voltage-gated Na+ channels open.
Phase 1 = initial repolarization—inactivation of 
voltage-gated Na+ channels. Voltage-gated K+ 
channels begin to open.
Phase 2 = plateau (“platwo”)—Ca2+ influx 
through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels balances 
K+ efflux. Ca2+ influx triggers Ca2+ release 
from sarcoplasmic reticulum and myocyte 
contraction (excitation-contraction coupling).
Phase 3 = rapid repolarization—massive K+ 
efflux due to opening of voltage-gated slow 
delayed-rectifier K+ channels and closure of 
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
Phase 4 = resting potential—high K+ 
permeability through K+ channels.

Efective refractory period
Occurs in all cardiac myocytes except for those 
in the SA and AV nodes.
In contrast to skeletal muscle:
 � Cardiac muscle action potential has a 
plateau due to Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. 
 � Cardiac muscle contraction requires Ca2+ 
influx from ECF to induce Ca2+ release 
from sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+-induced 
Ca2+ release).
 � Cardiac myocytes are electrically coupled to 
each other by gap junctions.
Pacemaker action 
potential
Occurs in the SA and AV nodes. Key differences from the ventricular action potential include:
Phase 0 = upstroke—opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Fast voltage-gated Na+ channels are 
permanently inactivated because of the less negative resting potential of these cells. Results in a slow 
conduction velocity that is used by the AV node to prolong transmission from the atria to ventricles.
Phases 1 and 2 are absent.
Phase 3 = repolarization—inactivation of the Ca2+ channels and � activation of K+ channels � � K+ 
efflux.
Phase 4 = slow spontaneous diastolic depolarization due to If (“funny current”). If channels 
responsible for a slow, mixed Na+ inward/K+ outward current; different from INa in phase 0 of 
ventricular action potential. Accounts for automaticity of SA and AV nodes. The slope of phase 4 
in the SA node determines HR. ACh/adenosine � the rate of diastolic depolarization and � HR, 
while catecholamines � depolarization and � HR. Sympathetic stimulation � the chance that If 
channels are open and thus � HR.

Congenital heart diseases
RIGHT-TO-lEFT SHuNTS
Early cyanosis—“blue babies.” Often diagnosed 
prenatally or become evident immediately 
after birth. Usually require urgent surgical 
treatment and/or maintenance of a PDA.
The 5 T’s:
1. Truncus arteriosus (1 vessel)
2. Transposition (2 switched vessels)
3. Tricuspid atresia (3 = Tri)
4. Tetralogy of Fallot (4 = Tetra)
5. TAPVR (5 letters in the name)
Persistent truncus 
arteriosus
Truncus arteriosus fails to divide into 
pulmonary trunk and aorta due to failure of 
aorticopulmonary septum formation; most 
patients have accompanying VSD.
D-transposition of 
great arteries
A
Aorta leaves RV (anterior) and pulmonary 
trunk leaves LV (posterior) � separation of 
systemic and pulmonary circulations A . Not 
compatible with life unless a shunt is present 
to allow mixing of blood (eg, VSD, PDA, or 
patent foramen ovale).
Due to failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to 
spiral (narrow superior mediastinum causes “egg 
on a string” appearance on CXR).
Without surgical intervention, most infants die 
within the first few months of life.

Ebstein anomaly
Displacement of tricuspid valve leaflets 
downward into RV, artificially “atrializing”

S2. Ostium secundum defects most common 
and usually an isolated finding; ostium 
primum defects rarer and usually occur 
with other cardiac anomalies. Symptoms 
range from none to HF. Distinct from patent 
foramen ovale, which is due to failed fusion.
O2 saturation � in RA, RV, and pulmonary 
artery. May lead to paradoxical emboli 
(systemic venous emboli use ASD to bypass 
lungs and become systemic arterial emboli).
Associated with Down syndrome.

D
In fetal period, shunt is right to left (normal). 
In neonatal period, � pulmonary vascular 
resistance � shunt becomes left to right 
� progressive RVH and/or LVH and HF.
Associated with a continuous, “machinelike” 
murmur. Patency is maintained by PGE 
synthesis and low O2 tension. Uncorrected 
PDA D can eventually result in late cyanosis 
in the lower extremities (differential cyanosis).
PDA is normal in utero and normally closes only 
after birth.

Coarct
Aortic narrowing A  near insertion of ductus arteriosus (“juxtaductal”). Associated with bicuspid 
aortic valve, other heart defects, and Turner syndrome. Hypertension in upper extremities. Lower 
extremities are cold with weak, delayed pulses (brachiofemoral delay). With age, intercostal 
arteries enlarge due to collateral circulation; arteries erode ribs � notched appearance on CXR. 
Complications include HF, � risk of cerebral hemorrhage (berry aneurysms), aortic rupture, and 
possible infective endocarditis.
Persistent pulmonary 
hypertension of the 
newborn
Persistence of � pulmonary vascular resistance after birth. Associated with abnormal development 
and postpartum adaptation of pulmonary vasculature. Risk factors include aspiration of meconium-
stained amniotic fluid and neonatal pneumonia. Leads to right-to-left shunt through foramen 
ovale and ductus arteriosus. Newborn presents with signs of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea) and

Aortic dissection
A
Longitudinal intimal tear forming a false

distribution (possibly with ST depression on ECG), resolving with rest or nitroglycerin.
 � Vasospastic (formerly Prinzmetal or variant)—occurs at rest 2° to coronary artery spasm; 
transient ST elevation on ECG. Tobacco smoking is a risk factor; hypertension and 
hypercholesterolemia are not. Triggers include cocaine, alcohol, and triptans. Treat with Ca2+ 
channel blockers, nitrates, and smoking cessation (if applicable).

Coronary steal 
syndrome
Distal to coronary stenosis, vessels are maximally dilated at baseline. Administration of vasodilators 
(eg, dipyridamole, regadenoson) dilates normal vessels � blood is shunted toward well-perfused 
areas � ischemia in myocardium perfused by stenosed vessels. Principle behind pharmacologic 
stress tests with coronary vasodilators.
Sudden cardiac death
Unexpected death due to cardiac causes within 1 hour of symptom onset, most commonly due 
to lethal arrhythmia (eg, ventricular fibrillation). Associated with CAD (up to 70% of cases), 
cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic, dilated), and hereditary channelopathies (eg, long QT syndrome, 
Brugada syndrome). Prevent with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
Chronic ischemic

Diagnosis of 
myocardial infarction
In the first 6 hours, ECG is the gold standard.
Cardiac troponin I rises after 4 hours (peaks 
at 24 hr) and is � for 7–10 days; more specific 
than other protein markers.
CK-MB increases after 6–12 hours (peaks 
at 16–24 hr) and is predominantly found 
in myocardium but can also be released 
from skeletal muscle. Useful in diagnosing 
reinfarction following acute MI because levels 
return to normal after 48 hours.
ECG changes can include ST elevation 
(STEMI, transmural infarct), ST depression 
(NSTEMI, subendocardial infarct), 
hyperacute (peaked) T waves, T-wave 
inversion, and pathologic Q waves or poor R 
wave progression (evolving or old transmural

Atrial fibrillation
Irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with no discrete P waves. 
Arrhythmogenic activity usually originates from automatic 
foci near pulmonary vein ostia in left atrium. Common risk 
factors include hypertension and CAD. May predispose to 
thromboembolic events, particularly stroke. 
Management: rate and rhythm control, cardioversion. Definitive 
treatment is ablation of pulmonary vein ostia. Consider 
anticoagulation based on stroke risk.

Associated with underlying conditions such as COPD, 
pneumonia, HF.
Atrial flutter
Rapid succession of identical, consecutive atrial depolarization 
waves causing “sawtooth” appearance of P waves. Arrhythmogenic 
activity usually originates from reentry circuit around tricuspid 
annulus in right atrium.

Paroxysmal 
supraventricular 
tachycardia
Most often due to a reentrant tract between atrium and ventricle, 
most commonly in AV node. Commonly presents with sudden-

Treatment: terminate reentry rhythm by slowing AV node 
conduction (eg, vagal maneuvers, IV adenosine), electrical 
cardioversion if hemodynamically unstable. Definitive treatment 
is catheter ablation of reentry tract.
Wolff-Parkinson-White 
syndrome
Most common type of ventricular preexcitation 
syndrome. Abnormal fast accessory 
conduction pathway from atria to ventricle 
(bundle of Kent) bypasses rate-slowing AV 
node � ventricles partially depolarize earlier 
� characteristic delta wave with widened 
QRS complex and shortened PR interval. May 
result in reentry circuit � supraventricular

receptor blockers (eg, spironolactone), ICD, heart 
transplant.
Leads to systolic dysfunction.
Displays eccentric hypertrophy A  
(sarcomeres added in series). Compare 
to athlete’s heart, where LV and RV 
enlargement facilitates � SV and � CO.

RV
LV
60–70% of cases are familial, autosomal dominant 
(most commonly due to mutations in genes 
encoding sarcomeric proteins, such as myosin 
binding protein C and β-myosin heavy chain). 
Causes syncope during exercise and may lead 
to sudden death (eg, in young athletes) due to 
ventricular arrhythmia. 
Findings: S4, systolic murmur. May see mitral 
regurgitation due to impaired mitral valve closure. 
Treatment: cessation of high-intensity athletics, 
use of β-blocker or nondihydropyridine Ca2+ 
channel blockers (eg, verapamil). ICD if high risk. 
Avoid drugs that decrease preload (eg, diuretics, 
vasodilators).
Diastolic dysfunction ensues.
Displays ventricular concentric hypertrophy 
(sarcomeres added in parallel) B , often 
septal predominance. Myofibrillar disarray 
and fibrosis.
Classified as hypertrophic obstructive 
cardiomyopathy when LV outflow tract is 
obstructed. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy 
and systolic anterior motion of mitral valve 
� outflow obstruction � dyspnea, possible 
syncope. 
Other causes of concentric LV hypertrophy: 
chronic HTN, Friedreich ataxia.
Restrictive/infiltrative 
cardiomyopathy
Postradiation fibrosis, Löffler endocarditis, 
Endocardial fibroelastosis (thick fibroelastic tissue 
in endocardium of young children), Amyloidosis, 
Sarcoidosis, Hemochromatosis (PLEASe Help!). 
Diastolic dysfunction ensues. Can have low-
voltage ECG despite thick myocardium 
(especially in amyloidosis).
Löffler endocarditis—associated with 
hypereosinophilic syndrome; histology shows 
eosinophilic infiltrates in myocardium.

Heart failure
A
Clinical syndrome of cardiac pump dysfunction � congestion and low perfusion. Symptoms 
include dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue; signs include S3 heart sound, rales, jugular venous distention 
(JVD), pitting edema A .
Systolic dysfunction—heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), � EDV; � contractility 
often 2° to ischemia/MI or dilated cardiomyopathy.
Diastolic dysfunction—heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), normal EDV; 
� compliance (� EDP) often 2° to myocardial hypertrophy.
Right HF most often results from left HF. Cor pulmonale refers to isolated right HF due to 
pulmonary cause.
ACE inhibitors, ARBs, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, β-blockers (except in acute 
decompensated HF), and aldosterone receptor antagonists � mortality in HFrEF. Loop and 
thiazide diuretics are used mainly for symptomatic relief. Hydralazine with nitrate therapy 
improves both symptoms and mortality in select patients.
Left heart failure
Orthopnea
Shortness of breath when supine: � venous return from redistribution of blood (immediate gravity 
effect) exacerbates pulmonary vascular congestion.
Paroxysmal nocturnal 
dyspnea
Breathless awakening from sleep: � venous return from redistribution of blood, reabsorption of 
peripheral edema, etc.
Pulmonary edema
� pulmonary venous pressure � pulmonary venous distention and transudation of fluid. Presence 
of hemosiderin-laden macrophages (“HF” cells) in lungs.
Right heart failure
Congestive 
hepatomegaly
� central venous pressure � � resistance to portal flow. Rarely, leads to “cardiac cirrhosis.”

Transient loss of consciousness caused by a period of � cerebral blood flow. Types:
 � Reflex (most common)—vasovagal (common faint), situational (eg, coughing/sneezing, 
swallowing, defecation, micturition), carotid sinus hypersensitivity.
 � Orthostatic—hypovolemia, drugs (eg, antihypertensives), autonomic dysfunction.
 � Cardiac—arrhythmias, structural (eg, aortic stenosis, HCM).
Infective endocarditis
Infection of the endocardial surface of the 
heart, typically involving ≥1 heart valves. 
Caused by bacteria >> fungi. Forms:
 � Acute—classically S aureus (high virulence). 
Large destructive vegetations A  on 
previously normal valves. Rapid onset.
 � Subacute—classically viridans streptococci 
(low virulence). Smaller vegetations on 
congenitally abnormal or diseased valves. 
Sequela of dental procedures. Gradual 
onset.
Presents with fever (most common), new 
murmur, vascular and immunologic 
phenomena.
Vascular phenomena—septic embolism, 
petechiae, splinter hemorrhages (linear 
hemorrhagic lesions on nail bed B ), Janeway 
lesions (painless, flat, erythematous lesions on 
palms or soles).
Immunologic phenomena—immune complex 
deposition, glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes 
(painful [“Ouchy”], raised, violaceous lesions 
on finger or toe pads C ), Roth spots (Retinal 
hemorrhagic lesions with pale centers D).
Mitral valve (most common) > aortic valve.

injection drug use (don’t “tri” drugs).
Common associations:
 � Prosthetic valves—S epidermidis
 � GI/GU procedures—Enterococcus
 � Colon cancer—S gallolyticus
 � Gram ⊝—HACEK organisms 
(Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter [formerly 
Actinobacillus], Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, 
Kingella)
 � Culture ⊝—Coxiella, Bartonella
 � Injection drug use—S aureus, Pseudomonas, 
Candida
Endothelial injury � formation of vegetations 
consisting of platelets, fibrin, and microbes 
on heart valves � valve regurgitation, septic 
embolism (systemic circulation in left-sided 
endocarditis, pulmonary in right-sided).
Diagnosis requires multiple blood cultures and

Syphilitic heart 
disease
3° syphilis disrupts the vasa vasorum of the 
aorta with consequent atrophy of vessel wall 
and dilation of aorta and valve ring. 
May see calcification of aortic root, ascending 
aortic arch, and thoracic aorta. Leads to “tree 
bark” appearance of aorta.
Can result in aneurysm of ascending aorta or 
aortic arch, aortic insufficiency.
Acute pericarditis 
A
Inflammation of the pericardium (red arrows in A ). Commonly presents with sharp pain, 
aggravated by inspiration, and relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Often complicated 
by pericardial effusion (between yellow arrows in A ). Presents with friction rub. ECG changes 
include widespread/diffuse ST-segment elevation and/or PR depression.
Usually idiopathic, but may be due to viral infections (eg, coxsackievirus B), malignancy 
(metastasis), cardiac surgery, thoracic radiotherapy (early), MI (eg, postcardiac injury syndrome), 
autoimmune diseases (eg, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis), renal failure (uremia).
Treatment: NSAIDs, colchicine, glucocorticoids, dialysis (uremia).
Constrictive 
pericarditis
Chronic inflammation of pericardium � pericardial fibrosis +/– calcification � limited space 
for expansion � � ventricular filling. Usually idiopathic, but may be due to viral infections,

backs up into vena cava � Kussmaul sign. May be seen with constrictive pericarditis, restrictive 
cardiomyopathy, right HF, massive pulmonary embolism, right atrial or ventricular tumors. 
Myocarditis
Inflammation of myocardium. Major cause of SCD in adults < 40 years old.
Presentation highly variable, can include dyspnea, chest pain, fever, arrhythmias (persistent 
tachycardia out of proportion to fever is characteristic).
Multiple causes:
 � Viral (eg, adenovirus, coxsackie B, parvovirus B19, HIV, HHV-6, COVID-19); lymphocytic 
infiltrate with focal necrosis highly indicative of viral myocarditis
 � Parasitic (eg, Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii)
 � Bacterial (eg, Borrelia burgdorferi, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae)
 � Toxins (eg, carbon monoxide, black widow venom)
 � Rheumatic fever

The endocrine system comprises widely distributed organs that work in a 
highly integrated manner to orchestrate a state of hormonal equilibrium 
within the body. Generally speaking, endocrine diseases can be 
classified either as diseases of underproduction or overproduction, 
or as conditions involving the development of mass lesions—which 
themselves may be associated with underproduction or overproduction 
of hormones. Therefore, study the endocrine system first by learning the 
glands, their hormones, and their regulation, and then by integrating 
disease manifestations with diagnosis and management. Take time to 
learn the multisystem connections.

Thyroid diverticulum arises from floor of primitive pharynx and descends into neck. Connected to 
tongue by thyroglossal duct, which normally disappears but may persist as cysts or the pyramidal 
lobe of thyroid. Foramen cecum is normal remnant of thyroglossal duct. 
Most common ectopic thyroid tissue site is the tongue (lingual thyroid). Removal may result in 
hypothyroidism if it is the only thyroid tissue present.
Thyroglossal duct cyst A  presents as an anterior midline neck mass that moves with swallowing 
or protrusion of the tongue (vs persistent cervical sinus leading to pharyngeal cleft cyst in lateral 
neck).

Thyroid hormones
Thyroid produces triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), iodine-containing hormones that 
control the body’s metabolic rate.
soUrce
Follicles of thyroid. 5′-deiodinase converts T4 (the major thyroid product) to T3 in peripheral tissue (5, 
4, 3). Peripheral conversion is inhibited by glucocorticoids, β-blockers, and propylthiouracil (PTU). 
Reverse T3 (rT3) is a metabolically inactive byproduct of the peripheral conversion of T4 and its 
production is increased by growth hormone and glucocorticoids. Functions of thyroid peroxidase 
include oxidation, organification of iodine, and coupling of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and 
diiodotyrosine (DIT). Inhibited by PTU and methimazole. DIT + DIT = T4. DIT + MIT = T3. 
Wolff-Chaikoff effect—protective autoregulation; sudden exposure to excess iodine temporarily 
turns off thyroid peroxidase � � T3/T4 production.
FUnction
Only free hormone is active. T3 binds nuclear receptor with greater affinity than T4. T3 functions 
—7 B’s:
 � Brain maturation
 � Bone growth (synergism with GH and IGF-1)
 � β-adrenergic effects. � β1 receptors in heart � � CO, HR, SV, contractility; β-blockers alleviate 
adrenergic symptoms in thyrotoxicosis
 � Basal metabolic rate � (via � Na+/K+-ATPase � � O2 consumption, RR, body temperature)
 � Blood sugar (� glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis)
 � Break down lipids (� lipolysis)
 � Stimulates surfactant synthesis in Babies
regUlAtion
TRH � ⊕ TSH release � ⊕ follicular cells. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) may ⊕ 
follicular cells in Graves disease.
Negative feedback primarily by free T3/T4:
 � Anterior pituitary � � sensitivity to TRH
 � Hypothalamus � � TRH secretion
Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) binds most T3/T4 in blood. Bound T3/T4 = inactive.
 � � TBG in pregnancy, OCP use (estrogen � � TBG) � � total T3/T4
 � � TBG in steroid use, nephrotic syndrome

Hypothyroidism
Hashimoto thyroiditis
Also called chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-
sufficient regions. Associated with HLA-DR3 (differs by ethnicity), � risk of primary thyroid 
lymphoma (typically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma).
Findings: moderately enlarged, nontender thyroid. May be preceded by transient hyperthyroid 
state (“Hashitoxicosis”) due to follicular rupture and thyroid hormone release.
Serology: ⊕ antithyroid peroxidase (antimicrosomal) and antithyroglobulin antibodies.
Histology: Hürthle cells A , lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers B .
Postpartum thyroiditis—mild, self-limited variant of Hashimoto thyroiditis arising < 1 year after 
delivery.
Subacute 
granulomatous 
thyroiditis
Also called de Quervain thyroiditis. Usually, a self-limited disease. Natural history: transient 
hyperthyroidism � euthyroid state � hypothyroidism � euthyroid state. Often preceded by viral 
infection. 
Findings: � ESR, jaw pain, very tender thyroid (de Quervain is associated with pain).
Histology: granulomatous inflammation C .
Riedel thyroiditis
Also called invasive fibrous thyroiditis. May occur as part of IgG4-related disease spectrum (eg, 
autoimmune pancreatitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, noninfectious aortitis). Hypothyroidism occurs 
in 1⁄3 of patients. Fibrosis may extend to local structures (eg, trachea, esophagus), mimicking 
anaplastic carcinoma.
Findings: slowly enlarging, hard (rocklike), fixed, nontender thyroid.
Histology: thyroid replaced by fibrous tissue and inflammatory infiltrate D. 
Congenital 
hypothyroidism
Formerly called cretinism. Most commonly caused by thyroid dysgenesis (abnormal thyroid gland 
development; eg, agenesis, hypoplasia, ectopy) or dyshormonogenesis (abnormal thyroid hormone 
synthesis; eg, mutations in thyroid peroxidase) in iodine-sufficient regions.
Findings (6 P’s): pot-bellied, pale, puffy-faced child E  with protruding umbilicus, protuberant 
tongue F , and poor brain development.
Other causes
Iodine deficiency (most common cause worldwide; typically presents with goiter G ), iodine excess 
(Wolff-Chaikoff effect), drugs (eg, amiodarone, lithium), nonthyroidal illness syndrome (also 
called euthyroid sick syndrome; � T3 with normal/� T4 and TSH in critically ill patients).

Hyperthyroidism 
Graves disease
A
Most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (IgG, can cause 
transient neonatal hyperthyroidism; type II hypersensitivity) stimulates TSH receptors on thyroid 
(hyperthyroidism, diffuse goiter), dermal fibroblasts (pretibial myxedema), and orbital fibroblasts 
(Graves orbitopathy). Activation of T-cells � lymphocytic infiltration of retroorbital space 
� � cytokines (eg, TNF-α, IFN-γ) � � fibroblast secretion of hydrophilic GAGs � � osmotic 
muscle swelling, muscle inflammation, and adipocyte count � exophthalmos A . Often presents 
during stress (eg, pregnancy). Associated with HLA-DR3 and HLA-B8. 
Histology: tall, crowded follicular epithelial cells; scalloped colloid.
Toxic multinodular 
goiter
Focal patches of hyperfunctioning follicular cells distended with colloid working independently 
of TSH (due to TSH receptor mutations in 60% of cases). � release of T3 and T4. Hot nodules 
(hyperfunctioning nodules visualized on radioactive iodine scan) are rarely malignant.
Thyroid storm
Uncommon but serious complication that occurs when hyperthyroidism is incompletely treated/
untreated and then significantly worsens in the setting of acute stress such as infection, trauma, 
surgery. Presents with agitation, delirium, fever, diarrhea, coma, and tachyarrhythmia (cause 
of death). May see � LFTs. Treat with the 4 P’s: β-blockers (eg, propranolol), propylthiouracil, 
glucocorticoids (eg, prednisolone), potassium iodide (Lugol iodine). Iodide load � � T4 synthesis 
� Wolff-Chaikoff effect.
Jod-Basedow 
phenomenon
Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Occurs when a patient with iodine deficiency and partially 
autonomous thyroid tissue (eg, autonomous nodule) is made iodine replete. Can happen after iodine 
IV contrast or amiodarone use. Opposite to Wolff-Chaikoff effect.
Causes of goiter
Smooth/diffuse: Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary 
adenoma.
Nodular: toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid adenoma, thyroid cancer, thyroid cyst.
Thyroid adenoma
A
Benign solitary growth of the thyroid. Most are nonfunctional (“cold” on radioactive iodine scan), 
can rarely cause hyperthyroidism via autonomous thyroid hormone production (“hot” or “toxic”). 
Most common histology is follicular (arrows in A ); absence of capsular or vascular invasion 
(unlike follicular carcinoma).

Thyroid cancer
Typically diagnosed with fine needle aspiration; treated with thyroidectomy. Complications of 
surgery include hypocalcemia (due to removal of parathyroid glands), transection of recurrent 
laryngeal nerve during ligation of inferior thyroid artery (leads to dysphagia and dysphonia 
[hoarseness]), and injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve during ligation of 
superior thyroid vascular pedicle (may lead to loss of tenor usually noticeable in professional voice 
users).
Papillary carcinoma
A
Most common. Empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing (“Orphan Annie” eyes) A , 
psamMoma bodies, nuclear grooves (Papi and Moma adopted Orphan Annie). � risk with RET/
PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations, childhood irradiation.
Papillary carcinoma: most prevalent, palpable lymph nodes. Good prognosis.
Follicular carcinoma
Good prognosis. Invades thyroid capsule and vasculature (unlike follicular adenoma), uniform 
follicles; hematogenous spread is common. Associated with RAS mutation and PAX8-PPAR-γ 
translocations. Fine needle aspiration cytology may not be able to distinguish between follicular 
adenoma and carcinoma.
Medullary carcinoma
B
From parafollicular “C cells”; produces calcitonin, sheets of polygonal cells in an amyloid stroma 
B  (stains with Congo red). Associated with MEN 2A and 2B (RET mutations).
Undifferentiated/

Hypoglycemia in 
diabetes mellitus
Usually occurs in patients treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues (eg, sulfonylureas,

 � Neuroglycopenic symptoms: altered mental status, seizures, death due to insufficient glucose in 
CNS. May occur in the absence of preceding neurogenic symptoms in patients with attenuated 
autonomic response (hypoglycemia unawareness).
Treatment: simple carbohydrates (eg, glucose tablets, fruit juice), IM glucagon, IV dextrose.
Cushing syndrome
etiology
� cortisol due to a variety of causes: 
 � Exogenous glucocorticoids � � ACTH � bilateral adrenal atrophy. Most common cause. 
 � Primary adrenal adenoma, hyperplasia, or carcinoma � � ACTH � atrophy of uninvolved 
adrenal gland. 
 � ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease); paraneoplastic ACTH secretion (eg, 
small cell lung cancer, bronchial carcinoids) � bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Cushing disease is 
responsible for the majority of endogenous cases of Cushing syndrome.
Findings
MOON FACIES: Metabolic syndrome (hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia), Obesity 
(truncal weight gain with wasting of extremities, round “moon” facies A , dorsocervical fat pad 
“buffalo hump”), Osteoporosis, Neuropsychiatric (depression, anxiety, irritability), Facial plethora,

Treatment: transsphenoidal resection, postoperative pituitary irradiation for residual tumor.
Adrenal insufficiency
Inability of adrenal glands to generate enough glucocorticoids +/− mineralocorticoids for the body’s 
needs. Can be acute or chronic. Symptoms include weakness, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, 
muscle aches, weight loss, GI disturbances, sugar and/or salt cravings.
Treatment: glucocorticoid +/− mineralocorticoid replacement.

Addison disease—chronic 1° adrenal insufficiency; caused by adrenal atrophy or destruction. Most 
commonly due to autoimmune adrenalitis (high-income countries) or TB (low-income countries).
Secondary and 
tertiary adrenal 
insufficiency
� pituitary ACTH secretion (secondary) or � hypothalamic CRH secretion (tertiary). No 
hyperkalemia (aldosterone synthesis preserved due to functioning adrenal gland, intact RAAS), no 
hyperpigmentation.
2° adrenal insufficiency is due to pituitary pathologies, 3° adrenal insufficiency is most commonly 
due to abrupt cessation of chronic glucocorticoid therapy (HPA suppression). Tertiary from 
treatment.
Acute adrenal 
insufficiency
Also called adrenal (addisonian) crisis; often precipitated by acute stressors that � glucocorticoid 
requirements (eg, infection) in patients with pre-existing adrenal insufficiency or on 
glucocorticoid therapy. May present with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental

Hyperaldosteronism
Increased secretion of aldosterone from adrenal gland. Clinical features include hypertension, 
� or normal K+, metabolic alkalosis. 1° hyperaldosteronism does not directly cause edema due 
to aldosterone escape mechanism. However, certain 2° causes of hyperaldosteronism (eg, heart 
failure) impair the aldosterone escape mechanism, leading to worsening of edema.
Primary 
hyperaldosteronism
Seen in patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome). 
� aldosterone, � renin. Leads to treatment-resistant hypertension.
Secondary 
hyperaldosteronism
Seen in patients with renovascular hypertension, juxtaglomerular cell tumors (renin-producing), 
and edema (eg, cirrhosis, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome). 
Neuroendocrine 
tumors
Heterogeneous group of neoplasms originating from neuroendocrine cells (which have traits similar 
to nerve cells and hormone-producing cells). 
Most neoplasms occur in the GI system (eg, carcinoid, gastrinoma), pancreas (eg, insulinoma, 
glucagonoma), and lungs (eg, small cell carcinoma). Also in thyroid (eg, medullary carcinoma) 
and adrenals (eg, pheochromocytoma).
Neuroendocrine cells (eg, pancreatic β cells, enterochromaffin cells) share a common biologic 
function through amine precursor uptake decarboxylase (APUD) despite differences in 
embryologic origin, anatomic site, and secretory products (eg, chromogranin A, neuron-specific 
enolase [NSE], synaptophysin, serotonin, histamine, calcitonin). Treatment: surgical resection, 
somatostatin analogs.
Neuroblastoma
A
Most common tumor of the adrenal medulla in children, usually < 4 years old. Originates from 
neural crest cells. Occurs anywhere along the sympathetic chain. 
Most common presentation is abdominal distension and a firm, irregular mass that can cross the 
midline (vs Wilms tumor, which is smooth and unilateral). Less likely to develop hypertension 
than with pheochromocytoma (neuroblastoma is normotensive). Can also present with 
opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (“dancing eyes-dancing feet”).

Neuroendocrine cells secrete 5-HT, which undergoes hepatic first-pass metabolism and 
enzymatic breakdown by MAO in the lung. If 5-HT reaches the systemic circulation (eg, after 
liver metastasis), carcinoid tumor may present with carcinoid syndrome—episodic flushing, 
diarrhea, wheezing, right-sided valvular heart disease (eg, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonic 
stenosis), niacin deficiency (pellagra), � urinary 5-HIAA.

and often presents as polyhydramnios in utero (due to inability of fetus to swallow amniotic fluid). 
Neonates drool, choke, and vomit with first feeding. TEFs allow air to enter stomach (visible on 
CXR). Cyanosis is 2° to laryngospasm (to avoid reflux-related aspiration). Clinical test: failure to 
pass nasogastric tube into stomach. 
In H-type, the fistula resembles the letter H. In pure EA, CXR shows gasless abdomen.

Intestinal atresia
A
Presents with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension within first 1–2 days of life.
Duodenal atresia—failure to recanalize. X-ray A  shows “double bubble” (dilated stomach, 
proximal duodenum). Associated with Down syndrome.
Jejunal and ileal atresia—disruption of mesenteric vessels (typically SMA) � ischemic necrosis 
of fetal intestine � segmental resorption: bowel becomes discontinuous. X-ray may show “triple 
bubble” (dilated stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum) and gasless colon. Associated with cystic 
fibrosis and gastroschisis. May be caused by tobacco smoking or use of vasoconstrictive drugs 
(eg, cocaine) during pregnancy.
Hypertrophic pyloric 
stenosis
Narrow
pyloric
channel
Thickened and
lengthened
pylorus
Most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in infants. Palpable olive-shaped mass (due to 
hypertrophy and hyperplasia of pyloric sphincter muscle) in epigastric region, visible peristaltic 
waves, and nonbilious projectile vomiting at ∼ 2–6 weeks old. More common in firstborn males; 
associated with exposure to macrolides. 
Results in hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (2° to vomiting of gastric acid and 
subsequent volume contraction). 
Ultrasound shows thickened and lengthened pylorus. 
Treatment: surgical incision of pyloric muscles (pyloromyotomy).

Pancreas and spleen
embryology
A
stomach
Pancreas—derived from foregut. Ventral pancreatic bud contributes to uncinate process. Both 
ventral and dorsal buds contribute to pancreatic head and main pancreatic duct.
Annular pancreas—abnormal rotation of ventral pancreatic bud forms a ring of pancreatic tissue 
� encircles 2nd part of duodenum; may cause duodenal narrowing (arrows in A ) and vomiting. 
Associated with Down syndrome.
Pancreas divisum—ventral and dorsal parts fail to fuse at 7 weeks of development. Common 
anomaly; mostly asymptomatic, but may cause chronic abdominal pain and/or pancreatitis.
Spleen—arises in mesentery of the stomach (dorsal mesogastrium, hence, mesodermal), but has 
foregut supply (celiac trunk � splenic artery).

ducts, as well as lymphatics) A .
Apical surface of hepatocytes faces bile 
canaliculi. Basolateral surface faces sinusoids. 
Kupffer cells (specialized macrophages) located 
in sinusoids clear bacteria and damaged or 
senescent RBCs.
Hepatic stellate (Ito) cells in space of Disse 
store vitamin A (when quiescent) and produce 
extracellular matrix (when activated). 
Responsible for hepatic fibrosis.
Dual blood supply to liver: portal vein (~80%) 
and hepatic artery (~20%). 
Zone I—periportal zone:
 � Affected 1st by viral hepatitis
 � Best oxygenated, most resistant to circulatory

Diaphragmatic hernia
A
Abdominal structures enter the thorax. Bowel sounds may be heard on chest auscultation. Most 
common causes: 
 � Infants—congenital defect of pleuroperitoneal membrane � left-sided herniation (right 
hemidiaphragm is relatively protected by liver) A .
 � Adults—laxity/defect of phrenoesophageal membrane � hiatal hernia (herniation of stomach 
through esophageal hiatus). 
Sliding hiatal hernia—gastroesophageal 
junction is displaced upward as gastric cardia 
slides into hiatus; “hourglass stomach.” Most 
common type. Associated with GERD.

Bile
Composed of bile salts (bile acids conjugated to 
glycine or taurine, making them water soluble), 
phospholipids, cholesterol, bilirubin, water, 
and ions. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase catalyzes 
rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis.
Functions:
 � Digestion and absorption of lipids and fat-
soluble vitamins
 � Bilirubin and cholesterol excretion (body’s 1° 
means of elimination)
 � Antimicrobial activity (via membrane 
disruption)
� absorption of enteric bile salts at distal ileum 
(as in short bowel syndrome, Crohn disease) 
prevents normal fat absorption and may cause 
bile acid diarrhea.
Calcium, which normally binds oxalate, binds 
fat instead, so free oxalate is absorbed by gut 
� � frequency of calcium oxalate kidney 
stones.
Bilirubin
Heme is metabolized by heme oxygenase to biliverdin (green), which is subsequently reduced to 
bilirubin (yellow-brown). Unconjugated bilirubin is removed from blood by liver, conjugated with 
glucuronate, and excreted in bile. 
Direct bilirubin: conjugated with glucuronic acid; water soluble (dissolves in water).

common in older patients. Confirmed by angiography. Associated with end-stage renal disease, 
von Willebrand disease, aortic stenosis.
Chronic mesenteric 
ischemia
“Intestinal angina”: atherosclerosis of celiac artery, SMA (most commonly affected), or IMA 
� intestinal hypoperfusion � postprandial epigastric pain � food aversion and weight loss.
Colonic ischemia
Crampy abdominal pain followed by hematochezia. Commonly occurs at watershed areas (splenic 
flexure, rectosigmoid junction). Typically affects older adults. Thumbprint sign on imaging due to 
mucosal edema/hemorrhage.
Ileus
Intestinal hypomotility without obstruction � constipation and � flatus; distended/tympanic 
abdomen with � bowel sounds. Associated with abdominal surgeries, opiates, hypokalemia, sepsis. 
No transition zone on imaging. Treatment: bowel rest, electrolyte correction, cholinergic drugs 
(stimulate intestinal motility).
Necrotizing 
enterocolitis
Seen in premature, formula-fed infants with immature immune system. Necrosis of intestinal 
mucosa (most commonly terminal ileum and proximal colon), which can lead to pneumatosis 
intestinalis (arrows in B ), pneumoperitoneum, portal venous gas.
Proctitis
Inflammation of rectal mucosa, usually associated with infection (N gonorrhea, Chlamydia, 
Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella, HSV, CMV), IBD, and radiation. Patients report tenesmus, 
rectal bleeding, and rectal pain. Proctoscopy reveals inflamed rectal mucosa (ulcers/vesicles in the 
case of HSV). Rectal swabs are used to detect other infectious etiologies.
Small bowel 
obstruction
Normal flow of intraluminal contents is interrupted � fluid accumulation and intestinal dilation 
proximal to blockage and intestinal decompression distal to blockage. Presents with abrupt onset 
of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension. Compromised blood flow due to 
excessive dilation or strangulation may lead to ischemia, necrosis, or perforation. Most commonly 
caused by intraperitoneal adhesions (fibrous band of scar tissue), tumors, and hernias (in rare 
cases, meconium plug in newborns � meconium ileus). Upright abdominal x-ray shows air-fluid 
levels C . Management: gastrointestinal decompression, volume resuscitation, bowel rest. 
Small intestinal 
bacterial overgrowth
Abnormal bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine (normally low bacterial colony count). Risk 
factors: altered pH (eg, achlorhydria, PPI use), anatomical (eg, small bowel obstruction, adhesions, 
fistula, gastric bypass surgery, blind loop), dysmotility (eg, gastroparesis), immune mediated (IgA 
deficiency, HIV). Presents with bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, chronic watery diarrhea, 
malabsorption (vitamin B12) in severe cases. Diagnosis: carbohydrate breath test or small bowel 
culture.

Molecular 
pathogenesis of 
colorectal cancer
Chromosomal instability pathway: mutations in APC cause FAP and most sporadic cases of CRC

Benign neonatal 
hyperbilirubinemia
Formerly called physiologic neonatal jaundice. Mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by:
 � � fetal RBC turnover (� hematocrit and � fetal RBC lifespan).
 � Immature newborn liver (� UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity).
 � Sterile newborn gut (� conversion to urobilinogen � � deconjugation by intestinal brush border 
β-glucuronidase � � enterohepatic circulation).
β-glucuronidase—lysosomal enzyme for direct bilirubin deconjugation. Also found in breast milk. 
May lead to pigment stone formation.
Occurs in nearly all newborns after first 24 hours of life and usually resolves without treatment in 
1–2 weeks. Exaggerated forms:
Breastfeeding failure jaundice—insufficient breast milk intake � � bilirubin elimination in stool � 
� enterohepatic circulation.
Breast milk jaundice—� β-glucuronidase in breast milk � � deconjugation � � enterohepatic

edema [red arrows]).
Causes: Idiopathic, Gallstones, Ethanol, Trauma, Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune disease, 
Scorpion sting, Hypercalcemia/Hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dL), ERCP, Drugs (eg, sulfa 
drugs, NRTIs, protease inhibitors). I GET SMASHED.
Diagnosis by 2 of 3 criteria: acute epigastric pain often radiating to the back, serum amylase or 
lipase (more specific) to 3× upper limit of normal, or characteristic imaging findings.
Complications: pancreatic pseudocyst B  (lined by granulation tissue, not epithelium), abscess, 
necrosis, hemorrhage, infection, organ failure (ALI/ARDS, shock, renal failure), hypocalcemia 
(precipitation of Ca2+ soaps).
Chronic pancreatitis
Chronic inflammation, atrophy, calcification of the pancreas C . Major risk factors include alcohol 
use disorder and genetic predisposition (eg, cystic fibrosis, SPINK1 mutations); can be idiopathic. 
Complications include pancreatic insufficiency and pseudocysts.
Pancreatic insufficiency (typically when <10% pancreatic function) may manifest with steatorrhea, 
fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, diabetes mellitus.
Amylase and lipase may or may not be elevated (almost always elevated in acute pancreatitis).

Pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma
A
B
Very aggressive tumor arising from pancreatic ducts (disorganized glandular structure with cellular 
infiltration A ); often metastatic at presentation, with average survival ~ 1 year after diagnosis. 
Tumors more common in pancreatic head B  (lead to obstructive jaundice). Associated with CA 
19-9 tumor marker (also CEA, less specific). 
Risk factors:
 � Tobacco smoking (strongest risk factor)
 � Chronic pancreatitis (especially > 20 years)
 � Diabetes
 � Age > 50 years
Often presents with:
 � Abdominal pain radiating to back
 � Weight loss (due to malabsorption and anorexia)
 � Migratory thrombophlebitis—redness and tenderness on palpation of extremities (Trousseau 
syndrome)
 � Obstructive jaundice with palpable, nontender gallbladder (Courvoisier sign)

When studying hematology, pay close attention to the many cross 
connections to immunology. Make sure you master the different types 
of anemias. Be comfortable interpreting blood smears. When reviewing 
oncologic drugs, focus on mechanisms and adverse effects rather than 
details of clinical uses, which may be lower yield. 
Please note that solid tumors are covered in their respective organ 
system chapters.

Fetal erythropoiesis
Fetal erythropoiesis occurs in:
 � Yolk sac (3–8 weeks)
 � Liver (6 weeks–birth)
 � Spleen (10–28 weeks)
 � Bone marrow (18 weeks to adult)
Young liver synthesizes blood.
Hemoglobin 
development
Embryonic globins: ζ and ε.
Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) = α2γ2.
Adult hemoglobin (HbA1) = α2β2.
HbF has higher affinity for O2 due to less avid 
binding of 2,3-BPG, allowing HbF to extract 
O2 from maternal hemoglobin (HbA1 and 
HbA2) across the placenta. HbA2 (α2δ2) is a 
form of adult hemoglobin present in small 
amounts.
From fetal to adult hemoglobin:
Alpha always; gamma goes, becomes beta.

CD16 (FcR)
NK cell
Important in innate immunity, especially against intracellular pathogens. NK cells are larger than 
B and T cells, with distinctive cytoplasmic lytic granules (containing perforin and granzymes) 
that, when released, act on target cells to induce apoptosis. Distinguish between healthy and 
infected cells by identifying cell surface proteins (induced by stress, malignant transformation, or 
microbial infections). Induce apoptosis (natural killer) in cells that do not express class I MHC 
cell surface molecules, eg, virally infected cells in which these molecules are downregulated.
B cells
Mediate humoral immune response. Originate 
from stem cells in bone marrow and matures in 
marrow. Migrate to peripheral lymphoid tissue 
(follicles of lymph nodes, white pulp of spleen, 
unencapsulated lymphoid tissue). When antigen

Origin
During gel electrophoresis, hemoglobin 
migrates from the negatively charged cathode 
to the positively charged anode. HbA migrates 
the farthest, followed by HbF, HbS, and HbC. 
This is because the missense mutations in HbS 
and HbC replace glutamic acid ⊝ with valine 
(neutral) and lysine ⊕, respectively, making 
HbC and HbS more positively charged than 
HbA.

Antiglobulin test
Also called Coombs test. Detects the presence of antibodies against circulating RBCs.
Direct antiglobulin test—anti-human globulin (Coombs reagent) added to patient’s RBCs. RBCs 
agglutinate if RBCs are coated with anti-RBC Abs. Used for AIHA diagnosis.
Indirect antiglobulin test—normal RBCs added to patient’s serum. If serum has anti-RBC Abs, 
RBCs agglutinate when Coombs reagent is added. Used for pretransfusion testing.

Vitamin K–dependent coagulation
Procoagulation
Vitamin K deficiency—� synthesis of factors II, 
VII, IX, X, protein C, protein S.
Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase. 
Vitamin K administration can potentially 
reverse inhibitory effect of warfarin on clotting 
factor synthesis (delayed). FFP or PCC 
administration reverses action of warfarin 
immediately and can be given with vitamin K 
in cases of severe bleeding. 
Neonates lack enteric baKteria, which produce 
vitamin K. Early administration of vitamin K 
overcomes neonatal deficiency/coagulopathy. 
Suppression of gut flora by broad spectrum 
antibiotiKs can also contribute to deficiency.
Factor VII (seven)—shortest half-life.
Factor II (two)—longest (too long) half-life.
Anticoagulation 
Antithrombin inhibits thrombin (factor IIa) and 
factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa.
Heparin enhances the activity of antithrombin.
Principal targets of antithrombin: thrombin and 
factor Xa. 
Factor V Leiden mutation produces a factor V 
resistant to inhibition by activated protein C.

 � Encephalopathy and Erythrocyte basophilic stippling.
 � Abdominal colic and sideroblastic Anemia.
 � Drops—wrist and foot drop.
Treatment: chelation with succimer, EDTA, dimercaprol.
Exposure risk � in old houses (built before 1978) with chipped paint (children) and workplace (adults).
Sideroblastic anemia
Causes: genetic (eg, X-linked defect in ALA synthase gene), acquired (myelodysplastic syndromes), 
and reversible (alcohol is most common; also lead poisoning, vitamin B6 deficiency, copper 
deficiency, drugs [eg, isoniazid, linezolid]).
Lab findings: � iron, normal/� TIBC, � ferritin. Ringed sideroblasts (with iron-laden, Prussian

Megaloblastic anemia 
A
Impaired DNA synthesis � maturation of 
nucleus of precursor cells in bone marrow 
delayed relative to maturation of cytoplasm.
Causes: vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, 
medications (eg, hydroxyurea, phenytoin, 
methotrexate, sulfa drugs).
RBC macrocytosis, hypersegmented neutrophils 
(arrow in A ), glossitis.
Folate deficiency
Causes: malnutrition (eg, chronic alcohol 
overuse), malabsorption, drugs (eg, 
methotrexate, trimethoprim, phenytoin), 
� requirement (eg, hemolytic anemia, 
pregnancy).
� homocysteine, normal methylmalonic acid. 
No neurologic symptoms (vs B12 deficiency).
Vitamin B12 
(cobalamin) 
deficiency
Causes: pernicious anemia, malabsorption 
(eg, Crohn disease), pancreatic insufficiency, 
gastrectomy, insufficient intake (eg, veganism), 
Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm).
� homocysteine, � methylmalonic acid.
Neurologic symptoms: reversible dementia, 
subacute combined degeneration (due to 
involvement of B12 in fatty acid pathways and 
myelin synthesis): spinocerebellar tract, lateral 
corticospinal tract, dorsal column dysfunction. 
Folate supplementation in vitamin B12 
deficiency can correct the anemia, but worsens 
neurologic symptoms.
Historically diagnosed with the Schilling test, 
a test that determines if the cause is dietary 
insufficiency vs malabsorption.
Anemia 2° to insufficient intake may take several 
years to develop due to liver’s ability to store 
B12 (vs folate deficiency, which takes weeks to 
months).
Orotic aciduria
Inability to convert orotic acid to UMP 
(de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway) 
because of defect in UMP synthase. 
Autosomal recessive. Presents in children as 
failure to thrive, developmental delay, and 
megaloblastic anemia refractory to folate 
and B12. No hyperammonemia (vs ornithine 
transcarbamylase deficiency—� orotic acid 
with hyperammonemia).
Orotic acid in urine. 
Treatment: uridine monophosphate or uridine 
triacetate to bypass mutated enzyme.
Nonmegaloblastic 
anemia
Macrocytic anemia in which DNA synthesis is 
normal.
Causes: chronic alcohol overuse, liver disease. 
RBC macrocytosis without hypersegmented 
neutrophils.
Diamond-Blackfan

Normocytic, but can become microcytic.
Treatment: address underlying cause of 
inflammation, judicious use of blood

stimulating agents such as EPO (eg, in chronic 
kidney disease).
Aplastic anemia
A
Failure or destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. 
Causes (reducing volume from inside diaphysis): 
 � Radiation
 � Viral agents (eg, EBV, HIV, hepatitis viruses)
 � Fanconi anemia (autosomal recessive DNA 
repair defect � bone marrow failure); 
normocytosis or macrocytosis on CBC. 
Common associated findings include short 
stature, café-au-lait spots, thumb/radial 
defects, predisposition to malignancy.
 � Idiopathic (immune mediated, 1° stem cell 
defect); may follow acute hepatitis
 � Drugs (eg, benzene, chloramphenicol, 
alkylating agents, antimetabolites) 
� reticulocyte count, � EPO. 
Pancytopenia characterized by anemia, 
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (vs aplastic

morphology, but hypocellular bone marrow 
with fatty infiltration A .
Symptoms: fatigue, malaise, pallor, purpura,

Treatment: withdrawal of offending 
agent, immunosuppressive regimens (eg, 
antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine), bone 
marrow allograft, RBC/platelet transfusion, 
bone marrow stimulation (eg, GM-CSF).

in proteins interacting with RBC membrane 
skeleton and plasma membrane (eg, ankyrin, 
band 3, protein 4.2, spectrin). 
Small, round RBCs with no central pallor. 
� surface area/dehydration � � MCHC 
�  premature removal by spleen (extravascular 
hemolysis).

exposure to hypotonic solution). Normal to 
� MCV with abundance of RBCs.
Treatment: splenectomy.
Paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria
Hematopoietic stem cell mutation 
� � complement-mediated intravascular 
hemolysis, especially at night. Acquired PIGA 
mutation � impaired GPI anchor synthesis 
for decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55) and 
membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL/
CD59), which protect RBC membrane from 
complement. 
Triad: Coombs ⊝ hemolytic anemia (mainly 
intravascular), pancytopenia, venous 
thrombosis (eg, Budd-Chiari syndrome).
Pink/red urine in morning. Associated with 
aplastic anemia, acute leukemias.

X-linked recessive. G6PD defect  
� � NADPH � � reduced glutathione 
� � RBC susceptibility to oxidative stress 
(eg, sulfa drugs, antimalarials, fava beans) 
� hemolysis.
Causes extravascular and intravascular hemolysis.
Back pain, hemoglobinuria a few days after 
oxidant stress.
Labs: � G6PD activity (may be falsely normal 
during acute hemolysis), blood smear shows 
RBCs with Heinz bodies and bite cells.
“Stress makes me eat bites of fava beans with 
Heinz ketchup.”
Pyruvate kinase 
deficiency
Autosomal recessive. Pyruvate kinase defect 
� � ATP � rigid RBCs � extravascular 
hemolysis. Increases levels of 2,3-BPG 
� � hemoglobin affinity for O2.
Hemolytic anemia in a newborn.
Labs: blood smear shows burr cells.
Sickle cell anemia
A
Point mutation in β-globin gene � single amino 
acid substitution (glutamic acid � valine) 
alters hydrophobic region on β-globin chain 
� aggregation of hemoglobin. Causes 
extravascular and intravascular hemolysis.
Pathogenesis: low O2, high altitude, or acidosis 
precipitates sickling (deoxygenated HbS 
polymerizes) � vaso-occlusive disease.
Newborns are initially asymptomatic because of 
� HbF and � HbS.
Heterozygotes (sickle cell trait) have resistance 
to malaria.
Sickle cells are crescent-shaped RBCs A .

� � risk of infection by encapsulated 
organisms (eg, Salmonella osteomyelitis).
 � Splenic infarct/sequestration crisis.
 � Painful vaso-occlusive crises: dactylitis 
(painful swelling of hands/feet), priapism, 
acute chest syndrome (respiratory distress, 
new pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, common 
cause of death), avascular necrosis, stroke.
 � Sickling in renal medulla (� Po2) � renal

Extrinsic hemolytic anemias
deScRIPtIon
FIndIngS
Autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia
A
A normocytic anemia that is usually idiopathic 
and Coombs ⊕. Two types:
 � Warm AIHA–chronic anemia in which 
primarily IgG causes extravascular 
hemolysis. Seen in SLE and CLL and with 
certain drugs (eg, β-lactams, α-methyldopa). 
“Warm weather is Good.”
 � Cold AIHA–acute anemia in which 
primarily IgM + complement cause RBC 
agglutination and extravascular hemolysis 
upon exposure to cold � painful, blue 
fingers and toes. Seen in CLL, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae infections, infectious 
mononucleosis. 
Spherocytes and agglutinated RBCs A  on 
peripheral blood smear.
Warm AIHA treatment: steroids, rituximab, 
splenectomy (if refractory).
Cold AIHA treatment: cold avoidance, 
rituximab.
Drug-induced 
hemolytic anemia
Most commonly due to antibody-mediated 
immune destruction of RBCs or oxidant injury 
via free radical damage (may be exacerbated in 
G6PD deficiency).
Common causes include antibiotics (eg, 
penicillins, cephalosporins), NSAIDs, 
immunotherapy, chemotherapy.
Spherocytes suggest immune hemolysis. 
Bite cells suggest oxidative hemolysis.
Can cause both extravascular and intravascular 
hemolysis.
Microangiopathic  
hemolytic anemia
RBCs are damaged when passing through 
obstructed or narrowed vessels. Causes 
intravascular hemolysis.
Seen in DIC, TTP/HUS, SLE, HELLP 
syndrome, hypertensive emergency.
Schistocytes (eg, “helmet cells”) are seen on 
peripheral blood smear due to mechanical 
destruction (schisto = to split) of RBCs.
Macroangiopathic 
hemolytic anemia
Prosthetic heart valves and aortic stenosis may 
also cause hemolytic anemia 2° to mechanical 
destruction of RBCs.
Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.
Hemolytic anemia due 
to infection
� destruction of RBCs (eg, malaria, Babesia).

Coagulation disorders
PT—tests function of common and extrinsic pathway (factors I, II, V, VII, and X). Defect � � PT 
(Play Tennis outside [extrinsic pathway]). 
INR (international normalized ratio) = patient PT/control PT. 1 = normal, > 1 = prolonged. Most 
common test used to follow patients on warfarin, which prolongs INR. 
PTT—tests function of common and intrinsic pathway (all factors except VII and XIII). Defect 
� � PTT (Play Table Tennis inside).
TT—measures the rate of conversion of fibrinogen � fibrin. Prolonged by anticoagulants, 
hypofibrinogenemia, DIC, liver disease.
Coagulation disorders can be due to clotting factor deficiencies or acquired factor inhibitors (most 
commonly against factor VIII). Diagnosed with a mixing study, in which normal plasma is added 
to patient’s plasma. Clotting factor deficiencies should correct (the PT or PTT returns to within 
the appropriate normal range), whereas factor inhibitors will not correct.

Peak incidence: 45–85 years; median age: 64 years. Defined by the Philadelphia chromosome 
(t[9;22], BCR-ABL) and myeloid stem cell proliferation. Presents with dysregulated production of 
mature and maturing granulocytes (eg, neutrophils, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, basophils E ) 
and splenomegaly. May accelerate and transform to AML or ALL (“blast crisis”). 
Responds to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, imatinib).

Malignant hematopoietic neoplasms with varying impacts on WBCs and myeloid cell lines.
Polycythemia vera
Primary polycythemia. Disorder of � RBCs, usually due to acquired JAK2 mutation. May present 
as intense itching after shower (aquagenic pruritus). Rare but classic symptom is erythromelalgia 
(severe, burning pain and red-blue coloration) due to episodic blood clots in vessels of the 
extremities A . Associated with hyperviscosity and thrombosis (eg, PE, DVT, Budd-Chiari 
syndrome).
� EPO (vs 2° polycythemia, which presents with endogenous or artificially � EPO). 
Treatment: phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor).
Essential 
thrombocythemia
Characterized by massive proliferation of megakaryocytes and platelets. Symptoms include 
bleeding and thrombosis. Blood smear shows markedly increased number of platelets, which may 
be large or otherwise abnormally formed B . Erythromelalgia may occur.
Myelofibrosis
Atypical megakaryocyte hyperplasia � � TGF-β secretion � � fibroblast activity � obliteration of 
bone marrow with fibrosis. Associated with massive splenomegaly and “teardrop” RBCs C . “Bone 
marrow cries because it’s fibrosed and is a dry tap.”

Heparin
mechanISm
Activates antithrombin, which � action primarily of factors IIa (thrombin) and Xa. Short half-life.
clInIcal USe
Immediate anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism (PE), acute coronary syndrome, MI, deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT). Used during pregnancy (does not cross placenta). Monitor PTT. 
adVeRSe eFFectS
Bleeding (reverse with protamine sulfate), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), osteoporosis 
(with long-term use), drug-drug interactions, type 4 renal tubular acidosis.
 � HIT type 1—mild (platelets > 100,000/mm3), transient, nonimmunologic drop in platelet count 
that typically occurs within the first 2 days of heparin administration. Not clinically significant.
 � HIT type 2—development of IgG antibodies against heparin-bound platelet factor 4 (PF4) that 
typically occurs 5–10 days after heparin administration. Antibody-heparin-PF4 complex binds 
and activates platelets � removal by splenic macrophages and thrombosis � �� platelet count. 
Highest risk with unfractionated heparin. Treatment: discontinue heparin, start alternative 
anticoagulant (eg, argatroban). Fondaparinux safe to use (does not interact with PF4).
noteS
Low-molecular-weight heparins (eg, enoxaparin, dalteparin) act mainly on factor Xa. Fondaparinux 
acts only on factor Xa. Both are not easily reversible. Unfractionated heparin used in patients with 
renal insufficiency (low-molecular-weight heparins should be used with caution because they 
undergo renal clearance).

Warfarin
mechanISm
Inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase by competing with vitamin K � inhibition of vitamin K–
dependent γ-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and proteins C and S. Metabolism 
affected by polymorphisms in the gene for vitamin K epoxide reductase complex (VKORC1). In 
laboratory assay, has effect on extrinsic pathway and � PT. Long half-life. 
“The ex-PresidenT went to war(farin).”
clInIcal USe
Chronic anticoagulation (eg, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and prevention of stroke 
in atrial fibrillation). Not used in pregnant patients (because warfarin, unlike heparin, crosses 
placenta). Monitor PT/INR.
adVeRSe eFFectS
A
Bleeding, teratogenic effects, skin/tissue necrosis A , drug-drug interactions (metabolized by 
cytochrome P-450 [CYP2C9]).
Initial risk of hypercoagulation: protein C has shorter half-life than factors II and X. Existing 
protein C depletes before existing factors II and X deplete, and before warfarin can reduce factors 
II and X production � hypercoagulation. Skin/tissue necrosis within first few days of large doses 
believed to be due to small vessel microthrombosis.
Heparin “bridging”: heparin frequently used when starting warfarin. Heparin’s activation of 
antithrombin enables anticoagulation during initial, transient hypercoagulable state caused by 
warfarin. Initial heparin therapy reduces risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism and skin/
tissue necrosis.
For reversal of warfarin, give vitamin K. For rapid reversal, give FFP or PCC.

This chapter provides information you will need to understand common 
anatomic dysfunctions, orthopedic conditions, rheumatic diseases, and 
dermatologic conditions. Be able to interpret 3D anatomy in the context 
of radiologic imaging. For the rheumatic diseases, create instructional 
cases that include the most likely presentation and symptoms: risk 
factors, gender, important markers (eg, autoantibodies), and other 
epidemiologic factors. Doing so will allow you to answer higher order 
questions that are likely to be asked on the exam.

Scaphoid (palpable in anatomic snuff box B ) 
is the most commonly fractured carpal bone, 
typically due to a fall on an outstretched hand. 
Complications of proximal scaphoid fractures 
include avascular necrosis and nonunion due 
to retrograde blood supply from a branch of 
the radial artery. Occult fracture not always 
seen on initial x-ray.
Dislocation of lunate may impinge median 
nerve and cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
Fracture of the hook of the hamate can cause

  Action potential opens presynaptic voltage-
gated Ca2+ channels, inducing acetylcholine 
(ACh) release.
  Postsynaptic ACh binding leads to muscle 
cell depolarization at the motor end plate.
  Depolarization travels over the entire 
muscle cell and deep into the muscle via the 
T-tubules.
  Membrane depolarization induces 
conformational changes in the voltage-
sensitive dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) 
and its mechanically coupled ryanodine 
receptor (RR) � Ca2+ release from the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum (buffered by 
calsequestrin) into the cytoplasm.
  Tropomyosin is blocking myosin-binding 
sites on the actin filament. Released 
Ca2+ binds to troponin C (TnC), shifting 
tropomyosin to expose the myosin-binding 
sites.
  Myosin head binds strongly to actin 
(crossbridge). Pi released, initiating power 
stroke.
  During the power stroke, force is produced 
as myosin pulls on the thin filament A . 
Muscle shortening occurs, with shortening 
of H and I bands and between Z lines (HI, 
I’m wearing shortZ). The A band remains 
the same length (A band is Always the same 
length). ADP is released at the end of the 
power stroke.
  Binding of new ATP molecule causes 
detachment of myosin head from actin 
filament. Ca2+ is resequestered.
  ATP hydrolysis into ADP and Pi results 
in myosin head returning to high-energy 
position (cocked). The myosin head can bind 
to a new site on actin to form a crossbridge if 
Ca2+ remains available.
  Reuptake of calcium by sarco(endo)plasmic 
reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) � muscle 
relaxation.

Bone formation
Endochondral 
ossification
Bones of axial skeleton, appendicular skeleton, and base of skull. Cartilaginous model of bone is 
first made by chondrocytes. Osteoclasts and osteoblasts later replace with woven bone and then 
remodel to lamellar bone. In adults, woven bone occurs after fractures and in Paget disease. 
Defective in achondroplasia.
Membranous 
ossification
Bones of calvarium, facial bones, and clavicle. Woven bone formed directly without cartilage. Later 
remodeled to lamellar bone.

Cell biology of bone
Osteoblast
Builds bone by secreting collagen and catalyzing mineralization in alkaline environment via ALP. 
Differentiates from mesenchymal stem cells in periosteum. Osteoblastic activity measured by 
bone ALP, osteocalcin, propeptides of type I procollagen.
Osteoclast
Dissolves (“crushes”) bone by secreting H+ and collagenases. Differentiates from a fusion of 
monocyte/macrophage lineage precursors. RANK receptors on osteoclasts are stimulated by 
RANKL (RANK ligand, expressed on osteoblasts). OPG (osteoprotegerin, a RANKL decoy 
receptor) binds RANKL to prevent RANK-RANKL interaction � � osteoclast activity.
Parathyroid hormone
At low, intermittent levels, exerts anabolic effects (building bone) on osteoblasts and osteoclasts 
(indirect). Chronically � PTH levels (1° hyperparathyroidism) cause catabolic effects (osteitis 
fibrosa cystica).
Estrogen
Inhibits apoptosis in bone-forming osteoblasts and induces apoptosis in bone-resorbing 
osteoclasts. Causes closure of epiphyseal plate during puberty. Estrogen deficiency (surgical or 
postmenopausal) � � cycles of remodeling and bone resorption � � risk of osteoporosis.

Common in children and as birth trauma. 
Usually caused by a fall on outstretched hand 
or by direct trauma to shoulder. Weakest point 
at the junction of middle and lateral thirds; 
fractures at the middle third segment are 
most common A. Presents as shoulder drop, 
shortened clavicle (lateral fragment is depressed 
due to arm weight and medially rotated by arm 
adductors [eg, pectoralis major]).

May also be seen with fracture/dislocation of 
the hook of hamate.
Carpal tunnel 
syndrome
Entrapment of median nerve in carpal tunnel 
(between transverse carpal ligament and carpal 
bones) � nerve compression � paresthesia, 
pain, and numbness in distribution of median 
nerve. Thenar eminence atrophies but 
sensation spared, because palmar cutaneous 
branch enters hand external to carpal tunnel. 
Suggested by ⊕ Tinel sign (percussion of wrist 
causes tingling) and Phalen maneuver (90° 
flexion of wrist causes tingling).
Associated with pregnancy (due to edema),

Usually resolves spontaneously.
Iliotibial band 
syndrome
Overuse injury of lateral knee that occurs primarily in runners. Pain develops 2° to friction of 
iliotibial band against lateral femoral epicondyle.
Limb compartment 
syndrome
� pressure within fascial compartment of a limb � venous outflow obstruction and arteriolar 
collapse � anoxia, necrosis, rhabdomyolysis � acute tubular necrosis. Causes include significant 
long bone fractures (eg, tibia), reperfusion injury, animal venoms. Presents with severe pain 
and tense, swollen compartments with passive stretch of muscles in the affected compartment. 
Increased serum creatine kinase and motor deficits are late signs of irreversible muscle and nerve 
damage. 5 P’s: pain, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness, paralysis.
Medial tibial stress 
syndrome 
Also called shin splints. Common cause of shin pain and diffuse tenderness in runners and military 
recruits. Caused by bone resorption that outpaces bone formation in tibial cortex.
Plantar fasciitis
Inflammation of plantar aponeurosis characterized by heel pain (worse with first steps in the 
morning or after period of inactivity) and tenderness. Associated with obesity, prolonged standing 
or jumping (eg, dancers, runners), and flat feet. Heel spurs often coexist.

Femur
Overuse injury that commonly presents in young, female athletes as anterior knee pain. 
Exacerbated by prolonged sitting or weight-bearing on a flexed knee.
Developmental 
dysplasia of the hip
Abnormal acetabulum development in newborns. Risk factor is breech presentation. Results in hip 
instability/dislocation. Commonly tested with Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers (manipulation of 
newborn hip reveals a “clunk”). Confirmed via ultrasound (x-ray not used until ~4–6 months 
because cartilage is not ossified).
Legg-Calvé-Perthes 
disease
Idiopathic avascular necrosis of femoral head. Commonly presents between 5–7 years with 
insidious onset of hip pain that may cause child to limp. More common in males (4:1 ratio). Initial 
x-ray often normal.

Achondroplasia
Failure of longitudinal bone growth (endochondral ossification) � short limbs. Membranous 
ossification is not affected � large head relative to limbs. Constitutive activation of fibroblast 
growth factor receptor (FGFR3) actually inhibits chondrocyte proliferation. > 85% of mutations 
occur sporadically; autosomal dominant with full penetrance (homozygosity is lethal). Associated 
with � paternal age. Most common cause of short-limbed dwarfism.
Osteoporosis
A
Trabecular (spongy) and cortical bone lose mass 
despite normal bone mineralization and lab 
values (serum Ca2+ and PO4
3−). 
Most commonly due to � bone resorption 
(� osteoclast number and activity) related 
to � estrogen levels, old age, and cigarette 
smoking. Can be 2° to drugs (eg, steroids, 
alcohol, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, 
thyroid replacement therapy) or other 
conditions (eg, hyperparathyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, multiple myeloma, 
malabsorption syndromes, anorexia).
Diagnosed by bone mineral density measurement 
by DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) 
at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral 
neck, with a T-score of ≤ −2.5 or by a fragility 
fracture (eg, fall from standing height, minimal 
trauma) at hip or vertebra. One-time screening 
recommended in females ≥ 65 years old.
Prophylaxis: regular weight-bearing exercise 
and adequate Ca2+ and vitamin D intake 
throughout adulthood.
Treatment: bisphosphonates, teriparatide, 
SERMs, denosumab (monoclonal antibody 
against RANKL).
Can lead to vertebral compression 
fractures A —acute back pain, loss of height, 
kyphosis. Also can present with fractures of 
femoral neck, distal radius (Colles fracture).

Osteopetrosis
A
Failure of normal bone resorption due to defective osteoclasts � thickened, dense bones that are 
prone to fracture. Mutations (eg, carbonic anhydrase II) impair ability of osteoclast to generate 
acidic environment necessary for bone resorption. Overgrowth of cortical bone fills marrow space 
� pancytopenia, extramedullary hematopoiesis. Can result in cranial nerve impingement and 
palsies due to narrowed foramina. 
X-rays show diffuse symmetric sclerosis (bone-in-bone, “stone bone” A ). Bone marrow transplant is 
potentially curative as osteoclasts are derived from monocytes.
Osteomalacia/rickets
A
Defective mineralization of osteoid 
(osteomalacia) or cartilaginous growth plates 
(rickets, only in children). Most commonly due 
to vitamin D deficiency.
X-rays show osteopenia and pseudofractures 
in osteomalacia, epiphyseal widening and 
metaphyseal cupping/fraying in rickets. 
Children with rickets have pathologic bow

bone. Serum Ca2+, phosphorus, and PTH 
levels are normal. � ALP. Mosaic pattern of 
woven and lamellar bone (osteocytes within 
lacunae in chaotic juxtapositions); long bone 
chalk-stick fractures. � blood flow from � 
arteriovenous shunts may cause high-output 
heart failure. � risk of osteosarcoma. 
Hat size can be increased due to skull thickening 
A ; hearing loss is common due to skull 
deformity. 
Stages of Paget disease:
 � Early destructive (lytic): osteoclasts
 � Intermediate (mixed): osteoclasts + osteoblasts
 � Late (sclerotic/blastic): osteoblasts
May enter quiescent phase.
Treatment: bisphosphonates.

Gout
FINDINgS
A
Acute inflammatory monoarthritis caused by precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joints. 
Risk factors: male sex, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, alcohol use. Strongest risk 
factor is hyperuricemia, which can be caused by:
 � Underexcretion of uric acid (90% of patients)—largely idiopathic, potentiated by renal failure; 
can be exacerbated by alcohol and certain medications (eg, thiazide diuretics).
 � Overproduction of uric acid (10% of patients)—Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, PRPP excess, � cell 
turnover (eg, tumor lysis syndrome), von Gierke disease.
Crystals are needle shaped and ⊝ birefringent under polarized light (yellow under parallel light, 
blue under perpendicular light A ). Serum uric acid levels may be normal during an acute attack.
SyMPtoMS
B
Asymmetric joint distribution. Joint is swollen, red, and painful. Classic manifestation is painful 
MTP joint of big toe (podagra). Tophus formation B  (often on external ear, olecranon bursa, or 
Achilles tendon). Acute attack tends to occur after a large meal with foods rich in purines (eg, red 
meat, seafood), trauma, surgery, dehydration, diuresis, or alcohol consumption (alcohol [beer > 
spirits] metabolites compete for same excretion sites in kidney as uric acid � � uric acid secretion 
and subsequent buildup in blood).
tREatMENt
Acute: NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin), glucocorticoids, colchicine. 
Chronic (preventive): xanthine oxidase inhibitors (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat).
Calcium 
pyrophosphate 
deposition disease
A
Formerly called pseudogout. Deposition of 
calcium pyrophosphate crystals within the 
joint space. Occurs in patients > 50 years old; 
both sexes affected equally. Usually idiopathic, 
sometimes associated with hemochromatosis, 
hyperparathyroidism, joint trauma. 
Pain and swelling with acute inflammation 
(pseudogout) and/or chronic degeneration 
(pseudo-osteoarthritis). Most commonly 
affected joint is the knee.

Cutaneous mycoses
Tinea 
(dermatophytes)
Clinical name for dermatophyte (cutaneous fungal) infections. Dermatophytes include 
Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton. Branching septate hyphae visible on KOH 
preparation with blue fungal stain A . Associated with pruritus. 
Tinea capitis
Occurs on head, scalp. Associated with lymphadenopathy, alopecia, scaling B .
Tinea corporis
Occurs on body (usually torso). Characterized by enlarging erythematous, scaly rings (“ringworm”) 
with central clearing C . Can be acquired from contact with infected pets or farm animals.
Tinea cruris
Occurs in inguinal area (“jock itch”) D. Often does not show the central clearing seen in tinea 
corporis.
Tinea pedis
Three varieties (“athlete’s foot”):
 � Interdigital E ; most common
 � Moccasin distribution F
 � Vesicular type
Tinea unguium
Onychomycosis; occurs on nails.
Tinea (pityriasis) 
versicolor
Caused by Malassezia spp. (Pityrosporum spp.), a yeastlike fungus (not a dermatophyte despite 
being called tinea). Degradation of lipids produces acids that inhibit tyrosinase (involved in 
melanin synthesis) � hypopigmentation G; hyperpigmentation and/or pink patches can also 
occur due to inflammatory response. Less pruritic than dermatophytes.
Can occur any time of year, but more common in summer (hot, humid weather). “Spaghetti and 
meatballs” appearance on microscopy H.
Treatment: selenium sulfide, topical and/or oral antifungal medications.

Skin cancer
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) more common above upper lip.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) more common below lower 
lip.
Sun exposure strongly predisposes to skin cancer.
Basal cell carcinoma
Most common skin cancer. Found in sun-exposed areas of body (eg, face). Locally invasive, but 
rarely metastasizes. Waxy, pink, pearly nodules, commonly with telangiectasias, rolled borders A, 
central crusting or ulceration. BCCs also appear as nonhealing ulcers with infiltrating growth B  or 
as a scaling plaque (superficial BCC) C . Basal cell tumors have “palisading” (aligned) nuclei D.
Squamous cell 
carcinoma
Second most common skin cancer. Associated with immunosuppression, chronic nonhealing 
wounds, and occasionally arsenic exposure. Marjolin ulcer—SCC arising in chronic wounds or 
scars; usually develops > 20 years after insult. Commonly appears on face E , lower lip F , ears, 
hands. Locally invasive, may spread to lymph nodes, and will rarely metastasize. Ulcerative red 
lesions. Histopathology: keratin “pearls”  G.
Actinic keratosis—Premalignant lesions caused by sun exposure. Small, rough, erythematous or 
brownish papules or plaques H. Risk of squamous cell carcinoma is proportional to degree of 
epithelial dysplasia.
Melanoma
Common tumor with significant risk of metastasis. S-100 tumor marker. Associated with dysplastic 
nevi; people with lighter skin tones are at � risk. Depth of tumor (Breslow thickness) correlates 
with risk of metastasis. Look for the ABCDEs: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, 
Diameter > 6 mm, and Evolution over time. At least 4 different types of melanoma, including 
superficial spreading I , nodular J , lentigo maligna K , and acral lentiginous (highest prevalence 
in people with darker skin tones) L . Often driven by activating mutation in BRAF kinase. 
Primary treatment is excision with appropriately wide margins. Advanced melanoma also treated 
with immunotherapy (eg, ipilimumab) and/or BRAF inhibitors (eg, vemurafenib).

Aspirin
mEChanism
NSAID that irreversibly (Aspirin) inhibits cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) by covalent 
acetylation � � synthesis of TXA2 and prostaglandins. � bleeding time. No effect on PT, PTT. 
Effect lasts until new platelets are produced.
CliniCal UsE
Low dose (< 300 mg/day): � platelet aggregation. Intermediate dose (300–2400 mg/day): antipyretic 
and analgesic. High dose (2400–4000 mg/day): anti-inflammatory.
adVERsE EFFECts
Gastric ulceration, tinnitus (CN VIII), allergic reactions (especially in patients with asthma or nasal 
polyps). Chronic use can lead to acute kidney injury, interstitial nephritis, GI bleeding. Risk of

Neurons 
Signal-transmitting cells of the nervous system. Permanent cells—do not divide in adulthood.
Signal-relaying cells with dendrites (receive input), cell bodies, and axons (send output). Cell bodies 
and dendrites can be seen on Nissl staining (stains RER). RER is not present in the axon. Neuron 
markers: neurofilament protein, synaptophysin.
Astrocytes
Largest and most abundant glial cell in CNS. 
Physical support, repair, removal of excess 
neurotransmitter, component of blood-brain 
barrier, glycogen fuel reserve buffer. Reactive 
gliosis in response to neural injury. 
Derived from neuroectoderm. 
GFAP ⊕.
Microglia
Phagocytic scavenger cells of CNS. Activation 
in response to tissue damage � release of 
inflammatory mediators (eg, nitric oxide, 
glutamate). Not readily discernible by Nissl

Myelin
� conduction velocity of signals transmitted 
down axons � saltatory conduction of action 
potential at the nodes of Ranvier, where there 
are high concentrations of Na+ channels. 
In CNS (including CN II), myelin is synthesized 
by oligodendrocytes; in PNS (including CN 
III-XII), myelin is synthesized by Schwann 
cells.
Myelin wraps and insulates axons: � membrane 
capacitance, � membrane resistance, � space

Wallerian degeneration—disintegration of the axon and myelin sheath distal to site of axonal injury 
with macrophages removing debris. 
Proximal to the injury, the axon retracts, and the cell body sprouts new protrusions that grow 
toward other neurons for potential reinnervation. Serves as a preparation for axonal regeneration

neural crest and mesoderm:
 � Dura mater—thick outer layer closest to 
skull.
 � Arachnoid mater—middle layer, contains 
weblike connections.
 � Pia mater—thin, fibrous inner layer that 
firmly adheres to brain and spinal cord.
CSF flows in the subarachnoid space, located 
between arachnoid and pia mater.

Blood-brain barrier
Prevents circulating blood substances 
(eg, bacteria, drugs) from reaching the CSF/
CNS. Formed by 4 structures:
 � Tight junctions between nonfenestrated 
capillary endothelial cells
 � Basement membrane
 � Pericytes
 � Astrocyte foot processes
Glucose and amino acids cross slowly by carrier-
mediated transport mechanisms.
Nonpolar/lipid-soluble substances cross rapidly 
via diffusion.
Circumventricular organs with fenestrated 
capillaries and no blood-brain barrier 
allow molecules in blood to affect brain 
function (eg, area postrema—vomiting after 
chemotherapy; OVLT [organum vasculosum 
lamina terminalis]—osmoreceptors) or 
neurosecretory products to enter circulation 
(eg, neurohypophysis—ADH release).

Coordinated by NTS in the medulla, which receives information from the chemoreceptor trigger 
zone (CTZ, located within area postrema (pronounce “puke”-strema) in 4th ventricle), GI tract 
(via vagus nerve), vestibular system, and CNS.
CTZ and adjacent vomiting center nuclei receive input through 5 major receptors: histamine (H1), 
muscarinic (M1), neurokinin (NK-1), dopamine (D2), and serotonin (5-HT3).
 � 5-HT3, D2, and NK-1 antagonists treat chemotherapy-induced vomiting.
 � H1 and M1 antagonists treat motion sickness; H1 antagonists treat hyperemesis gravidarum.

severe hypoxia). 
Also relies on a pressure gradient between 
mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial 
pressure (ICP). � blood pressure or � ICP 
� � cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).

� vasoconstriction � � cerebral blood flow 
� � ICP. May be used to treat acute cerebral

CPP = MAP – ICP. If CPP = 0, there is no 
cerebral perfusion � brain death (coma, 
absent brainstem reflexes, apnea).

Spinal nerves
There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal.
Nerves C1–C7 exit above the corresponding vertebrae (eg, C3 exits above the 3rd cervical vertebra). 
C8 spinal nerve exits below C7 and above T1. All other nerves exit below (eg, L2 exits below the 
2nd lumbar vertebra).
Spinal cord—lower 
extent
In adults, spinal cord ends at lower border of 
L1–L2 vertebrae. Subarachnoid space (which 
contains the CSF) extends to lower border 
of S2 vertebra. Lumbar puncture is usually 
performed between L3–L4 or L4–L5 (level of 
cauda equina) to obtain sample of CSF while 
avoiding spinal cord. To keep the cord alive, 
keep the spinal needle between L3 and L5.

CNS reflexes that are present in a healthy infant, but are absent in a neurologically intact adult.
Normally disappear within 1st year of life. These primitive reflexes are inhibited by a mature/
developing frontal lobe. They may reemerge in adults following frontal lobe lesions � loss of 
inhibition of these reflexes.
 Moro reflex
“Hang on for life” reflex—abduct/extend arms when startled, and then draw together.
 Rooting reflex
Movement of head toward one side if cheek or mouth is stroked (nipple seeking).
 Sucking reflex
Sucking response when roof of mouth is touched.
 Palmar reflex
Curling of fingers if palm is stroked.
Plantar reflex
Dorsiflexion of large toe and fanning of other toes with plantar stimulation.
Babinski sign—presence of this reflex in an adult, which may signify a UMN lesion.
 Galant reflex
Stroking along one side of the spine while newborn is in ventral suspension (face down) causes 
lateral flexion of lower body toward stimulated side.

Irreversible neuronal injury begins after 5 minutes of hypoxia. Most vulnerable: hippocampus 
(CA1 region), neocortex, cerebellum (Purkinje cells), watershed areas (“vulnerable hippos need 
pure water”). 
Stroke imaging: noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (before tPA can be given). CT detects 
ischemic changes in 6–24 hr. Diffusion-weighted MRI can detect ischemia within 3–30 min.

Ischemic stroke
A
Ischemia � infarction � liquefactive necrosis.
3 types:
 � Thrombotic—due to a clot forming directly at site of infarction (commonly the MCA A ), 
usually over a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque.
 � Embolic—due to an embolus from another part of the body. Can affect multiple vascular 
territories. Examples: atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis, DVT with patent foramen ovale 
(paradoxical embolism), infective endocarditis.
 � Hypoxic—due to systemic hypoperfusion or hypoxemia. Common during cardiovascular 
surgeries, tends to affect watershed areas.
Treatment: tPA (if within 3–4.5 hr of onset and no hemorrhage/risk of hemorrhage) and/or 
thrombectomy (if large artery occlusion). Reduce risk with medical therapy (eg, aspirin, 
clopidogrel); optimum control of blood pressure, blood sugars, lipids; smoking cessation; and treat 
conditions that � risk (eg, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis).
Transient ischemic 
attack
Brief, reversible episode of focal neurologic dysfunction without acute infarction (⊝ MRI), with the 
majority resolving in < 15 minutes; ischemia (eg, embolus, small vessel stenosis). May present with 
amaurosis fugax (transient visual loss) due to retinal artery emboli from carotid artery disease.
Cerebral edema
A
Fluid accumulation in brain parenchyma � � ICP. Types:
 � Cytotoxic edema—intracellular fluid accumulation due to osmotic shift (eg, Na+/K+-ATPase 
dysfunction � � intracellular Na+). Caused by ischemia (early), hyperammonemia, SIADH.
 � Vasogenic edema—extracellular fluid accumulation due to disruption of BBB (� permeability). 
Caused by ischemia (late), trauma, hemorrhage, inflammation, tumors (arrows in A  show 
surrounding vasogenic edema).

ventriculomegaly.
� dopamine, � GABA, � ACh in brain. 
Neuronal death via NMDA receptor binding 
and glutamate excitotoxicity.
Anticipation results from expansion of CAG

Also called central pontine myelinolysis. Massive axonal demyelination in pontine white matter 
A  2° to rapid osmotic changes, most commonly iatrogenic correction of hyponatremia but also 
rapid shifts of other osmolytes (eg, glucose). Acute paralysis, dysarthria, dysphagia, diplopia, loss of 
consciousness. Can cause “locked-in syndrome.”
Correcting serum Na+ too fast: 
 � “From low to high, your pons will die” (osmotic demyelination syndrome)
 � “From high to low, your brains will blow” (cerebral edema/herniation)
Acute inflammatory 
demyelinating 
polyneuropathy
Most common subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
Autoimmune condition that destroys Schwann cells via inflammation and demyelination of motor 
fibers, sensory fibers, peripheral nerves (including CN III-XII). Likely facilitated by molecular 
mimicry and triggered by inoculations or stress. Despite association with infections (eg, 
Campylobacter jejuni, viruses [eg, Zika]), no definitive causal link to any pathogen.
Results in symmetric ascending muscle weakness/paralysis and depressed/absent DTRs beginning 
in lower extremities. Facial paralysis (usually bilateral) and respiratory failure are common. May 
see autonomic dysregulation (eg, cardiac irregularities, hypertension, hypotension) or sensory 
abnormalities. Most patients survive with good functional recovery.
� CSF protein with normal cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation).
Respiratory support is critical until recovery. Disease-modifying treatment: plasma exchange or 
IV immunoglobulins. No role for steroids.
Acute disseminated 
(postinfectious) 
encephalomyelitis
Multifocal inflammation and demyelination after infection or vaccination. Presents with rapidly 
progressive multifocal neurologic symptoms, altered mental status.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
disease
Also called hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Group of progressive hereditary nerve 
disorders related to the defective production of proteins involved in the structure and function of 
peripheral nerves or the myelin sheath. Typically autosomal dominant and associated with foot 
deformities (eg, pes cavus, hammer toe), lower extremity weakness (eg, foot drop), and sensory 
deficits (Can’t Move Toes). Most common type, CMT1A, is caused by PMP22 gene duplication.
Progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy
B
Demyelination of CNS B  due to destruction of oligodendrocytes (2° to reactivation of latent JC 
virus infection). Associated with severe immunosuppression (eg, lymphomas and leukemias, 
AIDS, organ transplantation). Rapidly progressive, usually fatal. Predominantly involves parietal 
and occipital areas; visual symptoms are common. � risk associated with natalizumab.

Grade IV astrocytoma. Common, highly 
malignant 1° brain tumor with ~ 1-year 
median survival. Found in cerebral 
hemispheres. Can cross corpus callosum 
(“butterfly glioma” A ). Associated with EGFR 
amplification.
Astrocyte origin, GFAP ⊕. “Pseudopalisading” 
pleomorphic tumor cells B  border central areas 
of necrosis, hemorrhage, and/or microvascular 
proliferation. 
Oligodendroglioma
Relatively rare, slow growing. Most often in 
frontal lobes C . 
Often calcified.
Oligodendrocyte origin. “Fried egg” cells—round 
nuclei with clear cytoplasm D. 
“Chicken-wire” capillary pattern.
Meningioma
Common, typically benign. Females > males. 
Occurs along surface of brain or spinal cord. 
Extra-axial (external to brain parenchyma) 
and may have a dural attachment (“tail” E ). 
Often asymptomatic; may present with seizures 
or focal neurologic signs. Resection and/or 
radiosurgery.
Arachnoid cell origin. Spindle cells 
concentrically arranged in a whorled pattern; 
psammoma bodies (laminated calcifications, 
arrow in F ).
Hemangioblastoma
Most often cerebellar G. Associated with von 
Hippel-Lindau syndrome when found with 
retinal angiomas. Can produce erythropoietin 
� 2° polycythemia.

walled capillaries with minimal intervening 
parenchyma H.
Pituitary adenoma
May be nonfunctioning (silent) or 
hyperfunctioning (hormone-producing).

(eg, bitemporal hemianopia [due to pressure 
on optic chiasm I ]). Pituitary apoplexy 
� hypopituitarism.

amenorrhea, � bone density due to suppression 
of estrogen in females and as � libido, 
infertility in males.
Treatment: dopamine agonists (eg, 
bromocriptine, cabergoline), transsphenoidal 
resection.
Hyperplasia of only one type of endocrine cells 
found in pituitary. Most commonly from 
lactotrophs (prolactin) J  � hyperprolactinemia. 
Less commonly, from somatotrophs (GH)

present as hearing loss and tinnitus). Bilateral 
vestibular schwannomas found in NF-2. 
Resection or stereotactic radiosurgery.
Schwann cell origin, S-100 ⊕. Biphasic, dense, 
hypercellular areas containing spindle cells 
alternating with hypocellular, myxoid areas L .

Outer ear
Visible portion of ear (pinna), includes auditory canal and tympanic membrane. Transfers sound 
waves via vibration of tympanic membrane.
Middle ear
Air-filled space with three bones called the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes). Ossicles conduct and 
amplify sound from tympanic membrane to inner ear.
Inner ear
Snail-shaped, fluid-filled cochlea. Contains basilar membrane that vibrates 2° to sound waves. 
Vibration transduced via specialized hair cells � auditory nerve signaling � brainstem.
Each frequency leads to vibration at specific location on basilar membrane (tonotopy):
 � Low frequency heard at apex near helicotrema (wide and flexible).
 � High frequency heard best at base of cochlea (thin and rigid).
Otitis externa
A
Inflammation of external auditory canal. Most commonly due to Pseudomonas. Associated with 
water exposure (swimmer’s ear), ear canal trauma/occlusion (eg, hearing aids).
Presents with otalgia that worsens with ear manipulation, pruritus, hearing loss, discharge A .
Malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa—invasive infection causing osteomyelitis. Complication 
of otitis externa mostly seen in older patients with diabetes. Presents with severe otalgia and 
otorrhea. May lead to cranial nerve palsies. Physical exam shows granulation tissue in ear canal.
Otitis media
A
Inflammation of middle ear. Most commonly due to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis. Associated with eustachian tube dysfunction, 
which promotes overgrowth of bacterial colonizers of upper respiratory tract.
Usually seen in children < 2 years old. Presents with fever, otalgia, hearing loss. Physical exam 
shows bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane A  that may rupture.
Mastoiditis—infection of mastoid process of temporal bone. Complication of acute otitis media 
due to continuity of middle ear cavity with mastoid air cells. Presents with postauricular pain, 
erythema, swelling. May lead to brain abscess.

Common causes of hearing loss
Noise-induced 
hearing loss
Damage to stereociliated cells in organ of Corti. Loss of high-frequency hearing first. Sudden 
extremely loud noises can produce hearing loss due to tympanic membrane rupture.
Presbycusis
Aging-related progressive bilateral/symmetric sensorineural hearing loss (often of higher frequencies) 
due to destruction of hair cells at the cochlear base (preserved low-frequency hearing at apex).

Cholesteatoma
A
Abnormal growth of keratinized squamous epithelium in middle ear A  (“skin in wrong place”).
Usually acquired, but can be congenital. 1° acquired results from tympanic membrane retraction 
pockets that form due to eustachian tube dysfunction. 2° acquired results from tympanic membrane 
perforation (eg, due to otitis media) that permits migration of squamous epithelium to middle ear.
Classically presents with painless otorrhea. May erode ossicles � conductive hearing loss.
Vertigo
Sensation of spinning while actually stationary. Subtype of “dizziness,” but distinct from 
“lightheadedness.” Peripheral vertigo is more common than central vertigo.
Peripheral vertigo
Due to inner ear pathologies such as semicircular canal debris (benign paroxysmal positional 
vertigo), vestibular neuritis, Ménière disease—endolymphatic hydrops (� endolymph in inner 
ear) � triad of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus (“men wear vests”). Findings: mixed 
horizontal-torsional nystagmus (never purely torsional or vertical) that does not change direction 
and is suppressible with visual fixation.
Central vertigo
Due to brainstem or cerebellar lesions (eg, stroke affecting vestibular nuclei, demyelinating disease, 
or posterior fossa tumor). Findings: nystagmus of any direction that is not suppressible with visual 
fixation, neurologic findings (eg, diplopia, ataxia, dysmetria).

Glaucoma
Optic neuropathy causing progressive vision loss (peripheral � central). Usually, but not always, 
accompanied by � intraocular pressure (IOP). Etiology is most often 1°, but can be 2° to an 
identifiable cause (eg, uveitis, glucocorticoids). Funduscopy: optic disc cupping (normal A  vs 
thinning of outer rim of optic disc B ). Treatment: pharmacologic or surgical lowering of IOP.
Open-angle glaucoma
Anterior chamber angle is open (normal). Most common type in US. Associated with � resistance 
to aqueous humor drainage through trabecular meshwork. Risk factors: � age, race (� incidence 
in Black population), family history, diabetes mellitus. Typically asymptomatic and discovered 
incidentally.
Angle-closure 
glaucoma
Anterior chamber angle is narrowed or closed. Associated with anatomic abnormalities (eg, 
anteriorly displaced lens resting against central iris) � � aqueous flow through pupil (pupillary 
block) � pressure buildup in posterior chamber � peripheral iris pushed against cornea � 
obstruction of drainage pathways by the iris. Usually chronic and asymptomatic, but may develop 
acutely.
Acute angle-closure glaucoma—complete pupillary block causing abrupt angle closure and rapid 
� IOP. Presents with severe eye pain, conjunctival erythema C , sudden vision loss, halos around 
lights, headache, fixed and mid-dilated pupil, nausea and vomiting. Hurts in a hurry with halos,

Retinal disorders
Age-related macular 
degeneration
Degeneration of macula (central area of retina) � loss of central vision (scotomas). Two types:
 � Dry (most common)—gradual � in vision with subretinal deposits (drusen, arrow in A ).
 � Wet—rapid � in vision due to bleeding 2° to choroidal neovascularization. Distortion of straight 
lines (metamorphopsia) is an early symptom.
Diabetic retinopathy
Chronic hyperglycemia � � permeability and occlusion of retinal vessels. Two types: 
 � Nonproliferative (most common)—microaneurysms, hemorrhages (arrows in B ), cotton-wool 
spots, hard exudates. Vision loss mainly due to macular edema.
 � Proliferative—retinal neovascularization due to chronic hypoxia. Abnormal new vessels may 
cause vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment.
Hypertensive 
retinopathy
Chronic hypertension � spasm, sclerosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of retinal vessels. Funduscopy: 
arteriovenous nicking, microaneurysms, hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots (blue arrow in C ), hard 
exudates (may form macular “star,” red arrow in C ). Presence of papilledema is indicative of 
hypertensive emergency and warrants immediate lowering of blood pressure.
Retinal artery 
occlusion
Blockage of central or branch retinal artery usually due to embolism (carotid artery atherosclerosis 
> cardiogenic); less commonly due to giant cell arteritis. Presents with acute, painless monocular 
vision loss. Funduscopy: cloudy retina with “cherry-red” spot at fovea D, identifiable retinal 
emboli (eg, cholesterol crystals appear as small, yellow, refractile deposits in arterioles).
Retinal vein occlusion
Central retinal vein occlusion is due to 1° thrombosis; branch retinal vein occlusion is due to 2° 
thrombosis at arteriovenous crossings (sclerotic arteriole compresses adjacent venule causing 
turbulent blood flow). Funduscopy: retinal hemorrhage and venous engorgement (“blood and 
thunder” appearance; arrows in E ), retinal edema in affected areas.
Retinal detachment
Separation of neurosensory retina from underlying retinal pigment epithelium � loss of choroidal 
blood supply � hypoxia and degeneration of photoreceptors. Two types: 
 � Rhegmatogenous (most common)—due to retinal tears; often associated with posterior vitreous 
detachment (� risk with advanced age, high myopia), less frequently traumatic.
 � Nonrhegmatogenous—tractional or exudative (fluid accumulation).
Commonly presents with symptoms of posterior vitreous detachment (eg, floaters, light flashes) 
followed by painless monocular vision loss (“dark curtain”). Funduscopy: opacification and 
wrinkling of detached retina F , change in vessel direction. Surgical emergency.
Retinitis pigmentosa
Group of inherited dystrophies causing progressive degeneration of photoreceptors and retinal 
pigment epithelium. May be associated with abetalipoproteinemia. Early symptoms: night 
blindness (nyctalopia) and peripheral vision loss. Funduscopy: triad of optic disc pallor, retinal 
vessel attenuation, and retinal pigmentation with bone spicule-shaped deposits G.
Retinopathy of 
prematurity
Preterm birth � loss of normal hypoxic environment in utero � relative hyperoxia (� with 
supplemental O2 for NRDS) � � VEGF � arrest of normal retinal vascularization. As the 
eyes grow � hypoxia of avascular retina � � VEGF � retinal neovascularization (may cause 
tractional retinal detachment). Common cause of childhood blindness.
Papilledema
Optic disc swelling (usually bilateral) due to � ICP (eg, 2° to mass effect). Results from impaired 
axoplasmic flow in optic nerve. Funduscopy: elevated optic disc with blurred margins H.

Presents with leukocoria, strabismus, nystagmus, eye redness.
 
Leukocoria
A
Loss (whitening) of the red reflex. Important causes in children include retinoblastoma A , 
congenital cataract.
Uveitis
A
Inflammation of uvea; specific name based on location within affected eye. Anterior uveitis: iritis; 
posterior uveitis: choroiditis and/or retinitis. May have hypopyon (accumulation of pus in anterior

Pupillary control
Miosis
Constriction, parasympathetic:
 � 1st neuron: Edinger-Westphal nucleus to ciliary ganglion via CN III
 � 2nd neuron: short ciliary nerves to sphincter pupillae muscles
Short ciliary nerves shorten the pupil diameter.
Pupillary light reflex
Light in either retina sends a signal via CN II 
to pretectal nuclei (dashed lines in image) 
in midbrain that activates bilateral Edinger-
Westphal nuclei; pupils constrict bilaterally 
(direct and consensual reflex).
Result: illumination of 1 eye results in bilateral 
pupillary constriction.

Dilation, sympathetic:

 � 2nd neuron: exit at T1 to superior cervical ganglion (travels along cervical sympathetic chain 
near lung apex, subclavian vessels)
 � 3rd neuron: plexus along internal carotid, through cavernous sinus; enters orbit as long ciliary 
nerve to pupillary dilator muscles. Sympathetic fibers also innervate smooth muscle of eyelids 
(minor retractors) and sweat glands of forehead and face.
Long ciliary nerves make the pupil diameter longer.
Relative afferent 
pupillary defect
Also called Marcus Gunn pupil. Extent of pupillary constriction differs when light is shone in one 
eye at a time due to unilateral or asymmetric lesions of afferent limb of pupillary reflex (eg, retina, 
optic nerve). When light shines into a normal eye, constriction of the ipsilateral eye (direct reflex) 
and contralateral eye (consensual reflex) is observed. When light is swung from a normal eye to an 
affected eye, both pupils dilate instead of constricting.

CN III damage
CN III has both motor (central) and 
parasympathetic (peripheral) components. 
Common causes include:
 � Ischemia � pupil sparing (motor fibers 
affected more than parasympathetic fibers)
 � Uncal herniation � coma
 � PCom aneurysm � sudden-onset headache
 � Cavernous sinus thrombosis � proptosis, 
involvement of CNs IV, V1/V2, VI
 � Midbrain stroke � contralateral hemiplegia
Motor output to extraocular muscles—affected 
primarily by vascular disease (eg, diabetes 
mellitus: glucose � sorbitol) due to � diffusion 
of oxygen and nutrients to the interior (middle) 
fibers from compromised vasculature that 
resides on outside of nerve. Signs: ptosis, 
“down-and-out” gaze.
Parasympathetic output—fibers on the periphery 
are first affected by compression (eg, PCom 
aneurysm, uncal herniation). Signs: diminished 
or absent pupillary light reflex, “blown pupil” 
often with “down-and-out” gaze A .
Motor = middle (central)

Internuclear 
ophthalmoplegia
Medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF): pair of 
tracts that interconnect CN VI and CN III 
nuclei. Coordinates both eyes to move in same 
horizontal direction. Highly myelinated (must 
communicate quickly so eyes move at same 
time). Lesions may be unilateral or bilateral 
(latter classically seen in multiple sclerosis, 
stroke).
Lesion in MLF = internuclear ophthalmoplegia 
(INO), a conjugate horizontal gaze palsy. 
Lack of communication such that when 
CN VI nucleus activates ipsilateral lateral 
rectus, contralateral CN III nucleus does not 
stimulate medial rectus to contract. Abducting 
eye displays nystagmus (CN VI overfires to 
stimulate CN III). Convergence normal.
MLF in MS.
When looking left, the left nucleus of CN VI 
fires, which contracts the left lateral rectus and 
stimulates the contralateral (right) nucleus of 
CN III via the right MLF to contract the right 
medial rectus.
Directional term (eg, right INO, left INO) refers 
to the eye that is unable to adduct.

Amantadine (� dopamine release and � dopamine reuptake); mainly used to reduce levodopa-
induced dyskinesias; toxicity = peripheral edema, livedo reticularis, ataxia.
� l-DOPA availability
Agents prevent peripheral (pre-BBB) l-DOPA degradation � � l-DOPA entering CNS � � central 
l-DOPA available for conversion to dopamine.
 � Levodopa (l-DOPA)/carbidopa—carbidopa blocks peripheral conversion of l-DOPA to 
dopamine by inhibiting DOPA decarboxylase. Also reduces adverse effects of peripheral 
l-DOPA conversion into dopamine (eg, nausea, vomiting).
 � Entacapone and tolcapone prevent peripheral l-DOPA degradation to 3-O-methyldopa 
(3-OMD) by inhibiting COMT. Used in conjunction with levodopa.
Prevent dopamine 
breakdown
Agents act centrally (post-BBB) to inhibit breakdown of dopamine.
 � Selegiline, rasagiline—block conversion of dopamine into DOPAC by selectively inhibiting 
MAO-B, which is more commonly found in the Brain than in the periphery.
 � Tolcapone—crosses BBB and blocks conversion of dopamine to 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) in 
the brain by inhibiting central COMT.

meChAnism
Act as agonists at opioid receptors (μ = β-endorphin, δ = enkephalin, κ = dynorphin) to modulate 
synaptic transmission—close presynaptic Ca2+ channels, open postsynaptic K+ channels 
� � synaptic transmission. Inhibit release of ACh, norepinephrine, 5-HT, glutamate, substance P.
eFFiCACy
Full agonist: morphine, meperidine (long acting), methadone, codeine (prodrug; activated by 
CYP2D6), fentanyl.

Classical conditioning
Learning in which a natural response 
(salivation) is elicited by a conditioned, 
or learned, stimulus (bell) that previously 
was presented in conjunction with an 
unconditioned stimulus (food).
Usually elicits involuntary responses.
Pavlov’s classical experiments with dogs—
ringing the bell provoked salivation.
Operant conditioning
Learning in which a particular action is elicited because it produces a punishment or reward. 
Usually elicits voluntary responses.
Reinforcement
Target behavior (response) is followed by desired 
reward (positive reinforcement) or removal of 
aversive stimulus (negative reinforcement). 
Skinner operant conditioning quadrants:
Add a
stimulus
Remove a
stimulus
Increase behavior

punishment
Punishment
Repeated application of aversive stimulus 
(positive punishment) or removal of desired 
reward (negative punishment) to extinguish 
unwanted behavior.
Extinction
Discontinuation of reinforcement (positive or 
negative) eventually eliminates behavior. Can 
occur in operant or classical conditioning.
Transference and countertransference
Transference
Patient projects feelings about formative or other important persons onto physician (eg, psychiatrist

Dissociation
Temporary, drastic change in personality, 
memory, consciousness, or motor behavior to 
avoid emotional stress. Patient has incomplete 
or no memory of traumatic event.

Grief
Natural feeling that occurs in response to the death of a loved one. Symptoms and trajectory vary 
for each individual, are specific to each loss, and do not follow a fixed series of stages. In addition 
to guilt, sadness, and yearning, patients may experience somatic symptoms, hallucinations of the 
deceased, and/or transient episodes of wishing they had died with or instead of their loved one. 
Typical acute grief is time limited (adaptations within 6 months) and is not a disorder. 
Prolonged grief disorder—diagnosed if thoughts are persistent and prolonged, significantly impair 
functioning, and do not meet criteria for another disorder (eg, major depressive disorder [MDD]).
Normal infant and 
child development
Milestone dates are ranges that have been approximated and vary by source. Children not meeting 
milestones may need assessment for potential developmental delay.

Child abuse
Physical abuse
Sexual abuse
Emotional abuse
sigNs
Nonaccidental trauma (eg, 
fractures, bruises, burns). 
Injuries often in different 
stages of healing or in 
patterns resembling possible 
implements of injury. 
Includes abusive head trauma 
(shaken baby syndrome), 
characterized by subdural 
hematomas or retinal 
hemorrhages.
Caregivers may delay seeking 
medical attention for the 
child or provide explanations 
inconsistent with the child's 
developmental stage or 
pattern of injury.
STIs, UTIs, and genital, anal, 
or oral trauma. Most often, 
there are no physical signs; 
sexual abuse should not be 
excluded from a differential 
diagnosis in the absence of 
physical trauma.
Children often exhibit sexual 
knowledge or behavior 
incongruent with their age.
Babies or young children may 
lack a bond with the caregiver 
but are overly affectionate 
with less familiar adults. 
They may be aggressive 
toward children and animals 
or unusually anxious.
Older children are often 
emotionally labile and prone 
to angry outbursts. They may 
distance themselves from 
caregivers and other children. 
They can experience vague 
somatic symptoms for which 
a medical cause cannot be 
found. 
EPiDEMiology
40% of deaths related to child 
abuse or neglect occur in 
children < 1 year old.
Peak incidence 9–12 years old.
~80% of young adult victims of 
child emotional abuse meet 
the criteria for ≥ 1 psychiatric 
illness by age 21.
Child neglect
Failure to provide a child with adequate food, shelter, supervision, education, and/or affection. 
Most common form of child maltreatment. Signs: poor hygiene, malnutrition, withdrawal, 
impaired social/emotional development, failure to thrive.
As with other types of child abuse, suspected child neglect must be reported to local child 
protective services.
Vulnerable child 
syndrome
Parents perceive the child as especially susceptible to illness or injury (vs factitious disorder 
imposed on another). Usually follows a serious illness or life-threatening event. Can result in 
missed school or overuse of medical services.

Childhood and early-onset disorders
Attention-deficit 
hyperactivity 
disorder
Onset before age 12, but diagnosis can only be established after age 4. Characterized by 
hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention in ≥ 2 settings (eg, school, home, places of worship). 
Normal intelligence, but commonly coexists with difficulties in school. Often persists into 
adulthood. Commonly coexists with other behavioral, cognitive, or developmental disorders. 
Treatment: stimulants (eg, methylphenidate) +/– behavioral therapy; alternatives include 
atomoxetine and α2-agonists (eg, clonidine, guanfacine).
Autism spectrum 
disorder
Onset in early childhood. Social and communication deficits, repetitive/ritualized behaviors, 
restricted interests. May be accompanied by intellectual disability and/or above average abilities in 
specific skills (eg, music). More common in males. Associated with � head and/or brain size. 
Conduct disorder
Repetitive, pervasive behavior violating societal norms or the basic rights of others (eg, aggression 
toward people and animals, destruction of property, theft). After age 18, often reclassified as 
antisocial personality disorder. Conduct = children, antisocial = adults. Treatment: psychotherapy 
(eg, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]).

constantly angry and irritable between outbursts. Treatment: CBT, stimulants, antipsychotics.
Intellectual disability
Global cognitive deficits (vs specific learning disorder) that affect reasoning, memory, abstract 
thinking, judgment, language, learning. Adaptive functioning is impaired, leading to major 
difficulties with education, employment, communication, socialization, independence. 
Treatment: psychotherapy, occupational therapy, special education. 
Intermittent explosive 
disorder
Onset after age 6. Recurrent verbal or physical outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive 
impulses. Outbursts last < 30 minutes and are out of proportion to provocation and may lead 
to legal, financial, or social consequences. Episodes are not premeditated and may provide an 
immediate sense of relief, followed by remorse.  Treatment: psychotherapy, SSRIs.
Oppositional defiant 
disorder
Pattern of anger and irritability with argumentative, vindictive, and defiant behavior toward 
authority figures lasting ≥ 6 months. Treatment: psychotherapy (eg, CBT).
Selective mutism
Onset before age 5. Anxiety disorder lasting ≥ 1 month involving refraining from speech in certain 
situations despite speaking in other, usually more comfortable situations. Development (eg, speech and 
language) not typically impaired. Interferes with social, academic, and occupational tasks. Commonly 
coexists with social anxiety disorder. Treatment: behavioral, family, and play therapy; SSRIs.
Separation anxiety 
disorder
Overwhelming fear of separation from home or attachment figure lasting ≥ 4 weeks. Can be 
normal behavior up to age 3–4. May lead to factitious physical complaints to avoid school. 
Treatment: CBT, play therapy, family therapy.
Specific learning 
disorder
Onset during school-age years. Inability to acquire or use information from a specific subject 
(eg, math, reading, writing) near age-expected proficiency for ≥ 6 months despite focused 
intervention. General functioning and intelligence are normal (vs intellectual disability). 
Treatment: academic support, counseling, extracurricular activities.
Tourette syndrome
Onset before age 18. Sudden, recurrent, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor (eg, grimacing, 
shrugging) and vocal (eg, grunting, throat clearing) tics that persist for > 1 year. Coprolalia 
(involuntary obscene speech) found in some patients. Associated with OCD and ADHD. 
Treatment: psychoeducation, behavioral therapy. For intractable and distressing tics: 
tetrabenazine, antipsychotics, α2-agonists.

of a patient’s culture or religion (eg, a patient who believes that others are reading his thoughts). 
Types include erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, somatic, mixed, and unspecified. 
Disorganized thought
Speech may be incoherent (“word salad”), tangential, or derailed (“loose associations”).

disease.
 � Visual—more commonly due to neurologic disease (eg, dementia), delirium, or drug 
intoxication than psychiatric illness.
 � Tactile—common in alcohol withdrawal and stimulant use (eg, “cocaine crawlies,” a type of 
delusional parasitosis).

Contrast with illusions, which are misperceptions of real external stimuli (eg, mistaking a shadow 
for a black cat).
Mood disorder
Characterized by an abnormal range of moods or internal emotional states and loss of control over 
them. Severity of moods causes distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning.

Hypomanic episode
Similar to a manic episode except mood disturbance is not severe enough to cause marked 
impairment in social and/or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. 
Abnormally � activity or energy usually present. No psychotic features. Lasts ≥ 4 consecutive days.
Bipolar disorder
Bipolar I (requires 1 type of episode)—≥ 1 manic episode +/− a hypomanic or depressive episode 
(may be separated by any length of time).
Bipolar II (requires 2 types of episodes)—a hypomanic and a depressive episode (no history of 
manic episodes). 
Patient’s mood and functioning usually normalize between episodes. Use of antidepressants 
can destabilize mood. High suicide risk. Treatment: mood stabilizers (eg, lithium, valproate, 
carbamazepine, lamotrigine), atypical antipsychotics. 
Cyclothymic disorder—milder form of bipolar disorder fluctuating between mild depressive and 
hypomanic symptoms. Must last ≥ 2 years with symptoms present at least half of the time, with 
any remission lasting ≤ 2 months.
Major depressive 
disorder
Recurrent episodes lasting ≥ 2 weeks characterized by ≥ 5 of 9 diagnostic symptoms including 
depressed mood or anhedonia (or irritability in children). SIG: E CAPS: 
 � Sleep disturbances
 � � Interest in pleasurable activities (anhedonia)
 � Guilt or feelings of worthlessness
 � � Energy
 � � Concentration
 � Appetite/weight changes
 � Psychomotor retardation or agitation
 � Suicidal ideation
Screen for previous manic or hypomanic episodes to rule out bipolar disorder.
Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line; alternatives include SNRIs, mirtazapine, bupropion, 
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), ketamine.
Responses to a significant loss (eg, bereavement, natural disaster, disability) may resemble a 
depressive episode. Diagnosis of MDD is made if criteria are met.
MDD with psychotic 
features
MDD + hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic features are typically mood congruent (eg, 
depressive themes of inadequacy, guilt, punishment, nihilism, disease, or death) and occur only 
in the context of major depressive episode (vs schizoaffective disorder). Treatment: antidepressant 
with atypical antipsychotic, ECT.
Persistent depressive 
disorder
Also called dysthymia. Often milder than MDD; ≥ 2 depressive symptoms lasting ≥ 2 years (≥ 1 
year in children), with any remission lasting ≤ 2 months.
MDD with seasonal 
pattern
Formerly called seasonal affective disorder. Major depressive episodes occurring only during a 
particular season (usually winter) in ≥ 2 consecutive years and in most years across a lifetime. 
Atypical symptoms common. Treatment: standard MDD therapies + light therapy.
Depression with 
atypical features 
Characterized by mood reactivity (transient improvement in response to a positive event), 
hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis (heavy feeling in arms and legs), long-standing 
interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Most common subtype of depression. Treatment: CBT and 
SSRIs are first line. MAO inhibitors are effective but not first line because of their risk profile.

Peripartum mood 
disturbances
Onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks of delivery. � risk with history of mood disorders.
Postpartum blues
50–85% incidence rate. Characterized by depressed affect, tearfulness, and fatigue starting 2–3 
days after delivery. Usually resolves within 2 weeks. Treatment: supportive. Follow up to assess for 
possible MDD with peripartum onset.
MDD with peripartum 
onset
10–15% incidence rate. Formerly called postpartum depression. Meets MDD criteria with onset 
either during pregnancy or within 4 weeks after delivery. Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line.
Postpartum psychosis
0.1–0.2% incidence rate. Characterized by mood-congruent delusions, hallucinations, and thoughts 
of harming the baby or self. Risk factors include first pregnancy, family history, bipolar disorder, 
psychotic disorder, recent medication change. Treatment: hospitalization and initiation of atypical 
antipsychotic; if insufficient, ECT may be used.
Electroconvulsive 
therapy
Rapid-acting method to treat refractory depression, depression with psychotic symptoms, catatonia, 
and acute suicidality. Induces tonic-clonic seizure under anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade. 
Adverse effects include disorientation, headache, partial anterograde/retrograde amnesia usually 
resolving in 6 months. No absolute contraindications. Safe in pregnant individuals and older 
adults. 
Risk factors for suicide 
death
Sex (male)
Age (young adult or older adult)
Depression
Previous attempt (highest risk factor)
Ethanol or drug use
Rational thinking loss (psychosis) 
Sickness (medical illness)
Organized plan
No spouse or other social support
Stated future intent
SAD PERSONS are more likely to die from 
suicide.
Most common method in US is firearms; access 
to guns � risk of suicide death. 
Women try more often; men die more often. 
Other risk factors include recent psychiatric 
hospitalization and family history of suicide 
death.
Protective factors include effective care 
for comorbidities; medical, familial, or 
community connectedness; cultural/religious 
beliefs encouraging self-preservation; and 
strong problem-solving skills.
Anxiety disorders
Inappropriate experiences of fear/worry and their physical manifestations incongruent with 
the magnitude of the stressors. Symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition 
(eg, psychiatric disorder, hyperthyroidism) or substance use. Includes panic disorder, phobias, 
generalized anxiety disorder, and selective mutism.

Attacks typically peak in 10 minutes with ≥ 4 
of the following: palpitations, paresthesias, 
depersonalization or derealization, abdominal 
distress or nausea, intense fear of dying, 
intense fear of losing control, lightheadedness, 
chest pain, chills, choking, sweating,

Symptoms are systemic manifestations of fear.
Treatment: CBT, SSRIs, and venlafaxine are 
first line. Benzodiazepines occasionally used in 
acute setting.
Phobias
Severe, persistent (≥ 6 months) fear or anxiety due to presence or anticipation of a specific object or 
situation. Person often recognizes fear is excessive. Treatment: CBT with exposure therapy. 
Social anxiety disorder—exaggerated fear of embarrassment in social situations (eg, public 
speaking, using public restrooms). Treatment: CBT, SSRIs, venlafaxine. For performance type 
(eg, anxiety restricted to public speaking), use β-blockers or benzodiazepines as needed.
Agoraphobia—irrational fear, anxiety, and/or avoidance while facing or anticipating ≥ 2 specific 
situations (eg, public transportation, open/closed spaces, lines/crowds, being outside of home 
alone). Symptoms stem from the concern that help or escape may be unavailable. Associated with 
panic disorder. Treatment: CBT, SSRIs.

disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry about different aspects of daily life (eg, work, school, children) for 
most days of ≥ 6 months. Associated with ≥ 3 of the following for adults (≥ 1 for kids): difficulty

compulsions (repetitive, often time-consuming actions that may relieve distress). Associated with 
tic disorders. Poor insight into beliefs/actions linked to worse outcomes. Treatment: CBT and 
SSRIs; clomipramine and venlafaxine are second line.
Body dysmorphic disorder—preoccupation with minor or imagined defects in appearance. 
Causes significant emotional distress and repetitive appearance-related behaviors (eg, mirror 
checking, excessive grooming). Common in eating disorders. Treatment: CBT.
Trichotillomania—compulsively pulling out one’s hair. Causes significant distress and persists 
despite attempts to stop. Presents with areas of thinning hair or baldness on any area of the 
body, most commonly the scalp A . Remaining hair shafts are of different lengths (vs alopecia). 
Incidence highest in childhood but spans all ages. Treatment: psychotherapy.

Personality disorders
Inflexible, maladaptive, and rigidly pervasive patterns of behavior causing subjective distress and/
or impaired functioning; person is usually not aware of problem (egosyntonic). Usually present 
by early adulthood. Contrast with personality traits—nonpathologic enduring patterns of 
perception and behavior.
Three clusters:
 � Cluster A—odd or eccentric (remember as “weird”); inability to develop meaningful social 
relationships. No psychosis; genetic association with schizophrenia.
 � Cluster B—dramatic, emotional, or erratic (remember as “wild”); genetic association with mood 
disorders and substance use.
 � Cluster C—anxious or fearful (remember as “worried”); genetic association with anxiety 
disorders.
Cluster A
Paranoid
Pervasive distrust (accusatory), suspiciousness, hypervigilance, and a profoundly cynical view of the 
world.
Schizoid
Prefers social withdrawal and solitary activities (vs avoidant), limited emotional expression, 
indifferent to others’ opinions (aloof).
Schizotypal
Eccentric appearance, odd beliefs or magical thinking, interpersonal awkwardness. Included on 
the schizophrenia spectrum. Pronounce “schizo-type-al” for odd-type thoughts.
Cluster B
Antisocial
Disregard for the rights of others with lack of remorse (bad). Involves criminality, impulsivity, 
hostility, and manipulation (sociopath). Males > females. Must be ≥ 18 years old with evidence of 
conduct disorder onset before age 15. If patient is < 18, diagnosis is conduct disorder.
Borderline
Unstable mood and interpersonal relationships, fear of abandonment, impulsivity, self-mutilation, 
suicidality, sense of emotional emptiness (borderline). Females > males. Splitting is a major 
defense mechanism. Treatment: dialectical behavior therapy.
Histrionic
Attention-seeking, dramatic speech and emotional expression, shallow and labile emotions, 
sexually provocative. May use physical appearance to draw attention (flamboyant).
Narcissistic
Grandiosity, sense of entitlement; lacks empathy and requires excessive admiration; often demands 
the “best” and reacts to criticism with rage and/or defensiveness (must be the best). Fragile self-
esteem. Often envious of others.
Cluster C
Avoidant
Hypersensitive to rejection and criticism, socially inhibited, timid (cowardly), feelings of 
inadequacy, desires relationships with others (vs schizoid).
Obsessive-compulsive
Preoccupation with order, perfectionism, and control (obsessive-compulsive); egosyntonic: behavior 
consistent with one’s own beliefs and attitudes (vs OCD).
Dependent
Excessive need for support (clingy), submissive, low self-confidence. Patients often get stuck in 
abusive relationships.

Malingering
Symptoms are intentional, motivation is intentional. Patient consciously fakes, profoundly 
exaggerates, or claims to have a disorder in order to attain a specific 2° (external) gain (eg, 
avoiding work, obtaining compensation). Poor compliance with treatment or follow-up of 
diagnostic tests. Complaints cease after gain (vs factitious disorder).
Factitious disorders
Symptoms are intentional, motivation is unconscious. Patient consciously creates physical and/or 
psychological symptoms in order to assume “sick role” and to get medical attention and sympathy 
(1° [internal] gain).
Factitious disorder 
imposed on self
Formerly called Munchausen syndrome. Chronic factitious disorder with predominantly physical 
signs and symptoms. Characterized by a history of multiple hospital admissions and willingness to 
undergo invasive procedures. More common in females and healthcare workers. 
Factitious disorder 
imposed on another
Formerly called Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Illness in an individual being cared for (most 
often a child, also seen in disabled or older adults) is directly caused (eg, physically harming a 
child) or fabricated (eg, lying about a child’s symptoms) by the caregiver. Form of child/elder 
abuse.
Somatic symptom and 
related disorders
Symptoms are unconscious, motivation is unconscious. Category of disorders characterized by 
physical symptoms causing significant distress and impairment. Symptoms not intentionally 
produced or feigned. 
Somatic symptom 
disorder
≥ 1 bodily complaints (eg, abdominal pain, fatigue) lasting months to years. Associated with excessive, 
persistent thoughts and anxiety about symptoms. May co-occur with medical illness. Treatment: 
regular office visits with the same physician in combination with psychotherapy.
Conversion disorder
Also called functional neurologic symptom disorder. Unexplained loss of sensory or motor function 
(eg, paralysis, blindness, mutism), often following an acute stressor; patient may be aware of but 
indifferent toward symptoms (“la belle indifférence”); more common in females, adolescents, and 
young adults.
Illness anxiety 
disorder
Preoccupation with acquiring or having a serious illness, often despite medical evaluation and 
reassurance; minimal to no somatic symptoms.

Eating disorders
Most common in young women.
Anorexia nervosa
Intense fear of weight gain, overvaluation of thinness, and body image distortion leading to calorie 
restriction and severe weight loss resulting in inappropriately low body weight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 
for adults). Physiological disturbances may present as bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, 
hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, lanugo, amenorrhea (low calorie intake � � leptin � � GnRH 
� � LH, FSH � � estrogen � amenorrhea).
Binge-eating/purging type—recurring purging behaviors (eg, laxative or diuretic abuse, self-
induced vomiting) or binge eating over the last 3 months. Associated with hypokalemia.
Restricting type—primary disordered behaviors include dieting, fasting, and/or over-exercising. No 
recurring purging behaviors or binge eating over the last 3 months.
Refeeding syndrome—often occurs in significantly malnourished patients with sudden � calorie 
intake � � insulin � � PO4
3−, � K+, � Mg2+ � cardiac complications, rhabdomyolysis, seizures.
Treatment: nutritional rehabilitation, psychotherapy, olanzapine.
Bulimia nervosa
Recurring episodes of binge eating with compensatory purging behaviors at least weekly over the 
last 3 months. BMI often normal or slightly overweight (vs anorexia). Associated with parotid gland 
hypertrophy (may see � serum amylase), enamel erosion, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, electrolyte 
disturbances (eg, � K+, � Cl−), metabolic alkalosis, dorsal hand calluses from induced vomiting 
(Russell sign). 
Treatment: psychotherapy, nutritional rehabilitation, antidepressants (eg, SSRIs). Bupropion is 
contraindicated due to seizure risk.
Binge-eating disorder
Recurring episodes of binge eating without purging behaviors at least weekly over the last 
3 months. � diabetes risk. Most common eating disorder in adults.
Treatment: psychotherapy (first line); SSRIs; lisdexamfetamine.
Pica
Recurring episodes of eating non-food substances (eg, ice, dirt, hair, paint chips) over ≥ 1 month 
that are not culturally or developmentally recognized as normal. May provide temporary 
emotional relief. Common in children and during pregnancy. Associated with malnutrition, iron 
deficiency anemia, developmental disabilities, emotional trauma. 
Treatment: psychotherapy and nutritional rehabilitation (first line); SSRIs (second line).
Gender dysphoria
Significant incongruence between one’s gender identity and one’s gender assigned at birth, lasting 
> 6 months and leading to persistent distress. Individuals experience marked discomfort with their 
assigned gender, which interferes with social, academic, and other areas of function. Individuals 
may pursue multiple domains of gender affirmation, including social, legal, and medical.
Transgender—any individual who transiently or persistently experiences incongruence between 
their gender identity and their gender assigned at birth. Some individuals who are transgender 
will experience gender dysphoria. Nonconformity to one’s assigned gender itself is not a mental 
disorder.
Sexual dysfunction
Includes sexual desire disorders (hypoactive sexual desire or sexual aversion), sexual arousal 
disorders (erectile dysfunction), orgasmic disorders (anorgasmia, premature ejaculation), sexual 
pain disorders (genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder).
Differential diagnosis includes (PENIS):
 � Psychological (if nighttime erections still occur)
 � Endocrine (eg, diabetes, low testosterone)
 � Neurogenic (eg, postoperative, spinal cord injury)
 � Insufficient blood flow (eg, atherosclerosis)
 � Substances (eg, antihypertensives, antidepressants, ethanol)

Sleep terror disorder
Periods of inconsolable terror with screaming in the middle of the night. Most common in 
children. Occurs during slow-wave/deep (stage N3) non-REM sleep with no memory of the 
arousal episode, as opposed to nightmares that occur during REM sleep (remembering a scary 
dream). Triggers include emotional stress, fever, and lack of sleep. Usually self limited.
Enuresis
Nighttime urinary incontinence ≥ 2 times/week for ≥ 3 months in person > 5 years old. First-line 
treatment: behavioral modification (eg, scheduled voids, nighttime fluid restriction) and positive 
reinforcement. For refractory cases: bedwetting alarm, oral desmopressin (ADH analog; preferred 
over imipramine due to fewer adverse effects).
Narcolepsy
Excessive daytime sleepiness (despite awakening well-rested) with recurrent episodes of rapid-onset, 
overwhelming sleepiness ≥ 3 times/week for the last 3 months. Due to � orexin (hypocretin) 
production in lateral hypothalamus and dysregulated sleep-wake cycles. Associated with:
 � Hypnagogic (just before going to sleep) or hypnopompic (just before awakening; get pomped 
up in the morning) hallucinations.
 � Nocturnal and narcoleptic sleep episodes that start with REM sleep (sleep paralysis).
 � Cataplexy (loss of all muscle tone following strong emotional stimulus, such as laughter).
Treatment: good sleep hygiene (scheduled naps, regular sleep schedule), daytime stimulants (eg, 
amphetamines, modafinil) and/or nighttime sodium oxybate (GHB).
Substance use 
disorder
Maladaptive pattern of substance use involving ≥ 2 of the following in the past year:
 � Tolerance
 � Withdrawal
 � Intense, distracting cravings
 � Using more, or longer, than intended
 � Persistent desire but inability to cut down
 � Time-consuming substance acquisition, use, or recovery
 � Impaired functioning at work, school, or home
 � Social or interpersonal conflicts
 � Reduced recreational activities
 � > 1 episode of use involving danger (eg, unsafe sex, driving while impaired)
 � Continued use despite awareness of harm
In the case of appropriate medical treatment with prescribed medications (eg, opioid analgesics, 
sedatives, stimulants), symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal do not indicate a substance use disorder.
Gambling disorder
Persistent, recurrent, problematic gambling that cannot be better explained as a manic episode.
Diagnosis made if patient meets ≥ 4 of the following criteria:
 � Is preoccupied with gambling
 � Requires more gambling to reach desired level of excitement
 � Has failed efforts to limit, cut back, or stop gambling
 � Becomes restless or irritable when limiting or attempting to stop gambling
 � Gambles to escape or relieve feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety, or depression
 � After losing money gambling, continues gambling in an attempt to recover losses
 � Lies to conceal the extent of gambling
 � Puts at risk or has lost significant relationship, career, or academic pursuits because of gambling
 � Relies on money from others to fix financial collapse due to gambling
Treatment: psychotherapy.

Atypical antidepressants
Bupropion
Inhibits NE and DA reuptake. Also used for smoking cessation. Adverse effects: stimulant effects 
(tachycardia, insomnia), headache, seizures in patients with bulimia and anorexia nervosa. � risk 
of sexual adverse effects and weight gain compared to other antidepressants.
Mirtazapine
α2-antagonist (� release of NE and 5-HT), potent 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, and 
H1 antagonist. Adverse effects: sedation (which may be desirable in depressed patients with 
insomnia), � appetite, weight gain (which may be desirable in underweight patients), dry mouth.
Trazodone
Primarily blocks 5-HT2, α1-adrenergic, and H1 receptors; also weakly inhibits 5-HT reuptake. 
Used primarily for insomnia, as high doses are needed for antidepressant effects. Adverse effects: 
sedation, nausea, priapism, postural hypotension. Think traZZZobone due to sedative and male-
specific adverse effects.
Vilazodone
Inhibits 5-HT reuptake; 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. Used for MDD. Adverse effects: headache, 
diarrhea, nausea, anticholinergic effects. May cause serotonin syndrome if taken with other 
serotonergic agents.
Vortioxetine
Inhibits 5-HT reuptake; 5-HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Used for MDD. 
Adverse effects: nausea, sexual dysfunction, sleep disturbances, anticholinergic effects. May cause 
serotonin syndrome if taken with other serotonergic agents.
Pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation
Nicotine replacement 
therapy
Binds to nicotinic ACh receptors. Aim to relieve withdrawal symptoms upon stopping smoking. 
Long-acting patch and short-acting products (ie, gum, lozenge) can be used in combination. 
Adverse effects: headache, oral irritation.
Varenicline
Nicotinic ACh receptor partial agonist. Diminishes effect on reward system, but also reduces 
withdrawal. Adverse effects: GI discomfort, sleep disturbance. Varenicline helps nicotine cravings 
decline.
Medically supervised 
opioid withdrawal and 
relapse prevention
Injection drug use � risk for HBV, HCV, HIV, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, right-
sided infective endocarditis.
Methadone
Long-acting oral opioid used for medically supervised opioid (eg, heroin) withdrawal or long-term 
maintenance therapy.
Buprenorphine
Partial opioid agonist. Sublingual form (film) used to suppress withdrawal and for maintenance 
therapy. Partial agonists can precipitate withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent individuals or 
when administered shortly after use of a full agonist.
Naloxone
Short-acting opioid antagonist given IM, IV, or as a nasal spray to treat acute opioid overdose, 
particularly to reverse respiratory and CNS depression.
Naltrexone
Long-acting oral opioid antagonist used after detoxification to prevent relapse. May help alcohol 
and nicotine cessation, weight loss. Use naltrexone for the long trex back to sobriety.

persists in the male genital system as Wolffian 
duct, forming ductus deferens and epididymis.
Metanephros—permanent; first appears in week 
5 of development; nephrogenesis is normally 
completed by week 36 of gestation.
 � Ureteric bud (metanephric diverticulum)—
derived from caudal end of mesonephric

tissue; interaction induces differentiation 
and formation of glomerulus through to 
distal convoluted tubule (DCT)
 � Aberrant interaction between these 2

Renal clearance
Cx = (UxV)/Px = volume of plasma from which 
the substance is completely cleared in the 
urine per unit time.
If  Cx < GFR: net tubular reabsorption and/or 
not freely filtered.
If  Cx > GFR: net tubular secretion of X.
If  Cx = GFR: no net secretion or reabsorption.
Cx = clearance of X (mL/min).
Ux = urine concentration of X (eg, mg/mL).
Px = plasma concentration of X (eg, mg/mL).
V = urine flow rate (mL/min).
Glomerular filtration 
rate
Inulin clearance can be used to calculate GFR 
because it is freely filtered and is neither 
reabsorbed nor secreted.
Cinulin   = GFR = Uinulin × V/Pinulin
= Kf [(PGC – PBS) – (πGC – πBS)]
(PGC = glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure; 
PBS = Bowman space hydrostatic pressure; πGC = 
glomerular capillary oncotic pressure; πBS = 
Bowman space oncotic pressure; πBS normally 
equals zero; Kf = filtration coefficient).
Normal GFR ≈ 100 mL/min.
Creatinine clearance is an approximate measure

Renal blood flow 
autoregulation
Autoregulatory mechanisms help maintain a constant RBF and GFR to protect the kidney from 
rapid increases or decreases in renal perfusion pressure that could cause renal injury or decrease 
glomerular filtration. Mechanisms:
Myogenic: � arterial pressure � stretch of afferent arteriole� mechanical activation of vascular 
smooth muscle � vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole � � RBF.
Tubuloglomerular: � NaCl or tonicity of the filtrate sensed by macula densa cells � paracrine-
driven vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole � � RBF.
Effective renal plasma 
flow
Effective renal plasma flow (eRPF) can be 
estimated using para-aminohippuric acid 
(PAH) clearance. Between filtration and 
secretion, there is nearly complete excretion of 
all PAH that enters the kidney.

Glucose clearance
Glucose at a normal plasma level (range 60–120 
mg/dL) is completely reabsorbed in proximal 
convoluted tubule (PCT) by Na+/glucose 
cotransport.
In adults, at plasma glucose of ∼ 200 mg/dL, 
glucosuria begins (threshold). At rate of 
∼ 375 mg/min, all transporters are fully 
saturated (Tm). 
Normal pregnancy is associated with � GFR. 
With � filtration of all substances, including 
glucose, the glucose threshold occurs at lower 
plasma glucose concentrations � glucosuria at 
normal plasma glucose levels.
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors (eg, -flozin drugs) result in 
glucosuria at plasma concentrations 
< 200 mg/dL.
Glucosuria is an important clinical clue to 
diabetes mellitus.
Splay phenomenon—Tm for glucose is reached 
gradually rather than sharply due to the 
heterogeneity of nephrons (ie, different Tm 
points); represented by the portion of the 
titration curve between threshold and Tm.

Presence of casts indicates that hematuria/pyuria is of glomerular or renal tubular origin. 
Bladder cancer, kidney stones � hematuria, no casts.
Acute cystitis � pyuria, no casts.
All casts contain a matrix composed primarily of Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein (uromodulin), 
secreted by renal tubular cells to prevent UTIs.
RBC casts A
Glomerulonephritis, hypertensive emergency.
WBC casts B
Tubulointerstitial inflammation, acute pyelonephritis, transplant rejection. 
Granular casts C
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Can be “muddy brown” in appearance.

Key finding: granular casts (often muddy brown in appearance) A .
3 stages:
1. Inciting event
2. Maintenance phase—oliguric; lasts 1–3 weeks; risk of hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, 
uremia
3. Recovery phase—polyuric; BUN and serum creatinine fall; risk of hypokalemia and renal 
wasting of other electrolytes and minerals
Can be caused by ischemic or nephrotoxic injury:
 � Ischemic—2° to � renal blood flow (eg, prerenal azotemia). Results in death of tubular cells 
that may slough into tubular lumen B  (PT and thick ascending limb are highly susceptible to 
injury).
 � Nephrotoxic—2° to injury resulting from toxic substances (eg, aminoglycosides, radiocontrast 
agents, lead, cisplatin, ethylene glycol), myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), hemoglobinuria. PTs 
are particularly susceptible to injury.
Diffuse cortical 
necrosis
Acute generalized cortical infarction of both 
kidneys. Likely due to a combination of 
vasospasm and DIC. 
Associated with obstetric catastrophes (eg, 
placental abruption), septic shock.
Renal papillary 
necrosis
A
Sloughing of necrotic renal papillae A  � gross 
hematuria. May be triggered by recent 
infection or immune stimulus. 
Associated with: 
 � Sickle cell disease or trait
 � Acute pyelonephritis
 � Analgesics (eg, NSAIDs)
 � Diabetes mellitus
SAAD papa with papillary necrosis.
Consequences of renal 
failure 
Decline in renal filtration can lead to excess 
retained nitrogenous waste products and 
electrolyte disturbances.
Consequences (MAD HUNGER):
 � Metabolic Acidosis
 � Dyslipidemia (especially � triglycerides)
 � High potassium
 � Uremia
 � Na+/H2O retention (HF, pulmonary edema, 
hypertension)
 � Growth retardation and developmental delay
 � Erythropoietin deficiency (anemia)
 � Renal osteodystrophy
2 forms of renal failure: acute (eg, ATN) and 
chronic (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
congenital anomalies).
Incremental reductions in GFR define the stages 
of chronic kidney disease.
Normal phosphate levels are maintained during 
early stages of CKD due to � levels of fibroblast 
growth factor 23 (FGF23), which promotes 
renal excretion of phosphate. “FGF23 fights

Renal cyst disorders
Autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney 
disease
A
Numerous cysts in cortex and medulla A  causing bilateral enlarged kidneys ultimately destroy 
kidney parenchyma. Presents with combinations of flank pain, hematuria, hypertension, urinary 
infection, progressive renal failure in ~ 50% of individuals. 
Mutation in genes encoding polycystin protein: PKD1 (85% of cases, chromosome 16) or PKD2 
(15% of cases, chromosome 4). Complications include chronic kidney disease and hypertension 
(caused by � renin production). Associated with berry aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, benign 
hepatic cysts, diverticulosis.
Treatment: If hypertension or proteinuria develops, treat with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. 
Autosomal recessive 
polycystic kidney 
disease
B
Mutation in PKHD1 encoding fibrocystin. Cystic dilation of collecting ducts B . Often presents 
in infancy, and may be seen on prenatal ultrasound. Associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis.

period include systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and portal hypertension 
from congenital hepatic fibrosis.
Autosomal dominant 
tubulointerstitial 
kidney disease
Also called medullary cystic kidney disease. Causes tubulointerstitial fibrosis and progressive renal 
insufficiency with inability to concentrate urine. Medullary cysts usually not visualized; smaller 
kidneys on ultrasound. Poor prognosis.
Simple vs complex 
renal cysts
Simple cysts are filled with ultrafiltrate (anechoic on ultrasound). Very common and account for 
majority of all renal masses. Found incidentally and typically asymptomatic.
Complex cysts, including those that are septated, enhanced, or have solid components on imaging 
require follow-up or removal due to possibility of renal cell carcinoma.

Unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis 
(RAS) � � renal perfusion � � renin 
� � angiotensin � HTN. Most common 
cause of 2° HTN in adults.
Main causes of RAS:
 � Atherosclerotic plaques: proximal 1/3 of 
renal artery, usually in older males, smokers.
 � Fibromuscular dysplasia: distal 2/3 of renal 
artery or segmental branches, usually young 
or middle-aged females
For unilateral RAS, affected kidney can atrophy 
� asymmetric kidney size. Renal venous 
sampling will show � renin in affected kidney, 
� renin in unaffected kidney.
For bilateral RAS, patients can have a sudden rise 
in creatinine after starting an ACE inhibitor, 
ARB, or renin inhibitor, due to their interference 
on RAAS-mediated renal perfusion.
Can present with severe/refractory HTN, flash 
pulmonary edema, epigastric/flank bruit. 
Patients with RAS may also have stenosis in 
other large vessels.

Organizing the reproductive system by key concepts such as embryology, 
endocrinology, pregnancy, and oncology can help with understanding 
this complex topic. Study the endocrine and reproductive chapters 
together, because mastery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis 
is key to answering questions on ovulation, menstruation, disorders of 
sexual development, contraception, and many pathologies. 
Embryology is a nuanced subject that spans multiple organ systems. 
Approach it from a clinical perspective. For instance, make the 
connection between the presentation of DiGeorge syndrome and the 
3rd/4th pharyngeal pouch, and between the Müllerian/Wolffian systems 
and disorders of sexual development.
As for oncology, don’t worry about remembering screening or treatment 
guidelines. It is more important to recognize the clinical presentation 
(eg, signs and symptoms) of reproductive cancers and their associated 
labs, histopathology, and risk factors. In addition, some of the testicular 
and ovarian cancers have distinct patterns of hCG, AFP, LH, or FSH 
derangements that serve as helpful clues in exam questions.

Umbilical cord
Two umbilical arteries return deoxygenated 
blood from fetal internal iliac arteries to 
placenta.
One umbilical vein supplies oxygenated blood 
from placenta to fetus; drains into IVC via 
liver or via ductus venosus.
Single umbilical artery (2-vessel cord) is 
associated with congenital and chromosomal 
anomalies. 
Umbilical arteries and vein are derived from 
allantois.

Urachus
Allantois forms from yolk sac and extends into cloaca. Intra-abdominal remnant of allantois is 
called the urachus, a duct between fetal bladder and umbilicus. Failure of urachus to involute can 
lead to anomalies that may increase risk of infection and/or malignancy (eg, adenocarcinoma) 
if not treated. Obliterated urachus is represented by the median umbilical ligament after birth, 
which is covered by median umbilical fold of the peritoneum.
Patent urachus
Total failure of urachus to obliterate � urine discharge from umbilicus.
Urachal cyst
Partial failure of urachus to obliterate; fluid-filled cavity lined with uroepithelium, between

Begins at puberty with spermatogonia. Full 
development takes 2 months. Occurs in 
seminiferous tubules. Produces spermatids 
that undergo spermiogenesis (loss of 
cytoplasmic contents, gain of acrosomal cap) 
to form mature spermatozoa. 
“Gonium” is going to be a sperm; “zoon” is 
“zooming” to egg.
Tail mobility impaired in ciliary dyskinesia/

Oogenesis 
1° oocytes begin meiosis I during fetal life and complete meiosis I just prior to ovulation. 
Meiosis I is arrested in prophase I (one) for years until ovulation (1° oocytes).
Meiosis II is arrested in metaphase II (two) until fertilization (2° oocytes).
If fertilization does not occur within 1 day, the 2° oocyte degenerates.

ampulla). Occurs within 1 day of ovulation.
Implantation in the uterine wall occurs 6 days 
after fertilization. Syncytiotrophoblasts secrete 
hCG, which is detectable in blood 1 week 
after fertilization and on home urine tests 
2 weeks after fertilization.
Embryonic/developmental age—time since

Gestational age—time since first day of last 
menstrual period. Used clinically.
Gravidity (“gravida”)—number of pregnancies.
Parity (“para”)—number of pregnancies that

Human chorionic gonadotropin
SOURCE
Syncytiotrophoblast of placenta.
FUNCTION
Maintains corpus luteum (and thus progesterone) for first 8–10 weeks of gestation by acting like 
LH (otherwise no luteal cell stimulation � abortion). Luteal-placental shift is complete after 
8–10 weeks; placenta synthesizes its own estriol and progesterone and corpus luteum degenerates.
Used to detect pregnancy because it appears early in urine (see above).
Has identical α subunit as LH, FSH, TSH (states of � hCG can cause hyperthyroidism). β subunit 
is unique (pregnancy tests detect β subunit). hCG is � in multifetal gestation, hydatidiform 
moles, choriocarcinomas, and Down syndrome; hCG is � in ectopic/failing pregnancy, Edwards 
syndrome, and Patau syndrome.
Human placental 
lactogen
Also called human chorionic somatomammotropin.
SOURCE

Lactation
After parturition and delivery of placenta, rapid � in estrogen and progesterone disinhibits prolactin 
� initiation of lactation. Suckling is required to maintain milk production and ejection, since 
� nerve stimulation � � oxytocin and prolactin.
Prolactin—induces and maintains lactation and � reproductive function. 
Oxytocin—assists in milk letdown; also promotes uterine contractions.
Breast milk is the ideal nutrition for infants < 6 months old. Contains immunoglobulins 
(conferring passive immunity; mostly IgA), macrophages, lymphocytes. Breast milk reduces infant 
infections and is associated with � risk for child to develop asthma, allergies, diabetes mellitus, 
and obesity. Guidelines recommend exclusively breastfed infants get vitamin D and possibly iron 
supplementation.
Breastfeeding facilitates bonding with the child. Breastfeeding or donating milk � risk of breast and 
ovarian cancers. 
Menopause
Diagnosed by amenorrhea for 12 months. 
� estrogen production due to age-linked 
decline in number of ovarian follicles. Average 
age at onset is 51 years (earlier in people who 
smoke tobacco). 
Usually preceded by 4–5 years of abnormal 
menstrual cycles. Source of estrogen (estrone) 
after menopause becomes peripheral 
conversion of androgens, � androgens 
� hirsutism. 
�� FSH is specific for menopause (loss of 
negative feedback on FSH due to � estrogen).
Hormonal changes: � estrogen, �� FSH, � LH 
(no surge), � GnRH. 
Causes HAVOCS: Hot flashes (most common), 
Atrophy of the Vagina, Osteoporosis, Coronary 
artery disease, Sleep disturbances.
Menopause before age 40 suggests 1° ovarian 
insufficiency (premature ovarian failure); 
may occur in females who have received 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
Androgens
Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione.
SOURCE
DHT and testosterone (testis), androstenedione 
(adrenal)
Potency: DHT > testosterone > 
androstenedione.
FUNCTION
Testosterone: 
 � Differentiation of epididymis, vas deferens, 
seminal vesicles (internal genitalia, except 
prostate)
 � Growth spurt: penis, seminal vesicles, 
sperm, muscle, RBCs
 � Deepening of voice
 � Closing of epiphyseal plates (via estrogen 
converted from testosterone)
 � Libido
DHT:
 � Early—differentiation of penis, scrotum, 
prostate
 � Late—prostate growth, balding, sebaceous 
gland activity
Testosterone is converted to DHT by 
5α-reductase, which is inhibited by finasteride.
In the male, androgens are converted to estrogens 
by aromatase (primarily in adipose tissue and 
testes). 
Anabolic-androgenic steroid use—� fat-free 
mass, muscle strength, performance. Suspect in 
males who present with changes in behavior (eg, 
aggression), acne, gynecomastia, erythrocytosis 
(� risk of thromboembolism), small testes 
(exogenous testosterone � hypothalamic-
pituitary-gonadal axis inhibition 
� � intratesticular testosterone � � testicular 
size, � sperm count, azoospermia). Females may

maturation (eg, premature closure of epiphyseal plates � short stature). Types include: 
 � Central precocious puberty (� GnRH secretion): idiopathic (most common; early activation of 
hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis), CNS tumors.
 � Peripheral precocious puberty (GnRH-independent; � sex hormone production or exposure 
to exogenous sex steroids): congenital adrenal hyperplasia, estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor 
(eg, granulosa cell tumor), Leydig cell tumor, McCune-Albright syndrome.
Delayed puberty
Absence of 2° sexual characteristics by age 13 years in females and 14 years in males. Causes:
 � Hypergonadotropic (1°) hypogonadism: Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, gonadal injury 
(eg, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, infection).
 � Hypogonadotropic (2°) hypogonadism: constitutional delay of growth and puberty (“late

Aromatase deficiency
Inability to synthesize endogenous estrogens. Autosomal recessive. During fetal life, DHEA 
produced by fetal adrenal glands cannot be converted to estrogen by the placenta and is converted 
to testosterone peripherally � virilization of both female infant (atypical genitalia) and mother 
(acne, hirsutism; fetal androgens can cross placenta).
Androgen insensitivity 
syndrome
Defect in androgen receptor resulting in female-appearing genetic male (46,XY DSD); female 
external genitalia with scant axillary and pubic hair, rudimentary vagina; uterus and fallopian 
tubes absent due to persistence of anti-Müllerian hormone from testes. Patients develop normal 
functioning testes (often found in labia majora; surgically removed to prevent malignancy).

impair normal decidualization), placenta 
previa, � maternal age, multiparity. Three 
types depending on depth of trophoblast 
invasion:
 � Placenta accreta—attaches to myometrium 
(instead of overlying decidua basalis) without 
invading it. Most common type.
 � Placenta increta—partially invades into 
myometrium.
 � Placenta percreta—completely invades 
(“perforates”) through myometrium and 
serosa, sometimes extending into adjacent 
organs (eg, bladder � hematuria).
Presents with difficulty separating placenta 
from uterus after fetal delivery and severe 
postpartum hemorrhage upon attempted 
manual removal of placenta (often extracted in

Presents with painless vaginal bleeding in third trimester.
Low-lying placenta—located < 2 cm from, but not covering, the internal cervical os.
Vasa previa
Fetal vessels run over, or < 2 cm from, the internal cervical os. Risk factors: velamentous insertion 
of umbilical cord (inserts in chorioamniotic membrane rather than placenta � fetal vessels travel 
to placenta unprotected by Wharton jelly), bilobed or succenturiate placenta.
Presents with painless vaginal bleeding (fetal blood from injured vessels) upon rupture of 
membranes accompanied by fetal heart rate abnormalities (eg, bradycardia). May lead to fetal 
death from exsanguination.
Placental abruption
Also called abruptio placentae. Premature separation of placenta from uterus prior to fetal delivery. 
Risk factors: maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, smoking, cocaine use, abdominal trauma.
Presents with abrupt, painful vaginal bleeding in third trimester; can lead to maternal 
hypovolemic shock (due to hemorrhage) and DIC (due to release of tissue factor from injured 
placenta), fetal distress (eg, hypoxia). May be life threatening for both mother and fetus.

Consider surgical repair or treatment with collagenase injections once curvature stabilizes. 
Distinct from penile fracture (rupture of tunica albuginea due to forced bending).
Ischemic priapism
Painful sustained erection lasting > 4 hours. Associated with sickle cell disease (sickled RBCs 
block venous drainage of corpus cavernosum vascular channels), medications (eg, sildenafil, 
trazodone). Treat immediately with corporal aspiration, intracavernosal phenylephrine, or surgical 
decompression to prevent ischemia.
Squamous cell

trauma) or spontaneously. Characterized by acute, severe pain, high-riding testis, and absent 
cremasteric reflex. ⊝ Prehn sign.
Treatment: surgical correction (orchiopexy) within 6 hours, manual detorsion if surgical option 
unavailable in timeframe. If testis is not viable, orchiectomy. Orchiopexy, when performed, 
should be bilateral because the contralateral testis is at risk for subsequent torsion.
Varicocele
A
Dilated veins in pampiniform plexus due to � venous pressure; most common cause of scrotal 
enlargement in adult males. Most often on left side because of � resistance to flow from left 
gonadal vein drainage into left renal vein. Right-sided varicocele may indicate IVC obstruction

Chronic prostatitis—either bacterial or nonbacterial (eg, 2° to previous infection, nerve problems, 
chemical irritation).
Prostatic 
adenocarcinoma
Common in males > 50 years old. Arises most often from posterior lobe (peripheral zone) of 
prostate gland and is most frequently diagnosed by � PSA and subsequent needle core biopsies 
(transrectal, ultrasound-guided). Histologically graded using Gleason grade, which is based on 
glandular architecture and correlates closely with metastatic potential. Prostatic acid phosphatase 
(PAP) and PSA are useful tumor markers (� total PSA, with � fraction of free PSA). Osteoblastic 
metastases in bone may develop in late stages, as indicated by lower back pain and � serum ALP 
and PSA. Metastasis to the spine often occurs via Batson (vertebral) venous plexus.

When used in continuous fashion, first transiently act as GnRH agonists (tumor flare), but 
subsequently act as GnRH antagonists (downregulate GnRH receptor in pituitary � � FSH and 
� LH � � estrogen in females and � testosterone in males).
Can be used in lieu of GnRH.
ClINICAl USE
Uterine fibroids, endometriosis, precocious puberty, prostate cancer, infertility. Pulsatile for 
pregnancy, continuous for cancer.
ADVERSE EFFECTS
Hypogonadism, � libido, erectile dysfunction, nausea, vomiting.

replacement therapy in postmenopausal females.
ADVERSE EFFECTS
� risk of endometrial cancer (when given without progesterone), bleeding in postmenopausal 
patients, clear cell adenocarcinoma of vagina in females exposed to DES in utero, � risk of 
thrombi. Contraindications—ER ⊕ breast cancer, history of DVTs, tobacco use in females > 35 
years old.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators
Clomiphene 
Antagonist at estrogen receptors in hypothalamus. Prevents normal feedback inhibition and 
� release of LH and FSH from pituitary, which stimulates ovulation. Used to treat infertility due 
to anovulation (eg, PCOS). May cause hot flashes, ovarian enlargement, multiple simultaneous 
pregnancies, visual disturbances. 
Tamoxifen
Antagonist at breast, partial agonist at uterus, bone. Hot flashes, � risk of thromboembolic events 
(especially with tobacco smoking), and endometrial cancer. Used to treat and prevent recurrence 
of ER/PR ⊕ breast cancer and to prevent gynecomastia in patients undergoing prostate cancer 
therapy.
Raloxifene
Antagonist at breast, uterus; agonist at bone; hot flashes, � risk of thromboembolic events (especially 
with tobacco smoking), but no increased risk of endometrial cancer (vs tamoxifen, so you can 
“relax”); used primarily to treat osteoporosis.
Aromatase inhibitors
Anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane.

Hormone replacement 
therapy
Used for relief or prevention of menopausal symptoms (eg, hot flashes, vaginal atrophy), 
osteoporosis (� estrogen, � osteoclast activity).
Unopposed estrogen replacement therapy � risk of endometrial cancer, progesterone/progestin is 
added. Possible increased cardiovascular risk.
Progestins
Levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, etonogestrel, norethindrone, megestrol.
mECHANISm
Bind progesterone receptors, � growth and � vascularization of endometrium, thicken cervical 
mucus.
ClINICAl USE
Contraception (forms include pill, intrauterine device, implant, depot injection), endometrial 
cancer, abnormal uterine bleeding. Progestin challenge: presence of bleeding upon withdrawal of 
progestins excludes anatomic defects (eg, Asherman syndrome) and chronic anovulation without 
estrogen.
Antiprogestins
Mifepristone, ulipristal.
mECHANISm
Competitive inhibitors of progestins at progesterone receptors.
ClINICAl USE
Termination of pregnancy (mifepristone with misoprostol); emergency contraception (ulipristal).
Combined 
contraception
Progestins and ethinyl estradiol; forms include pill, patch, vaginal ring.
Estrogen and progestins inhibit LH/FSH and thus prevent estrogen surge. No estrogen surge � no 
LH surge � no ovulation. 
Progestins cause thickening of cervical mucus, thereby limiting access of sperm to uterus. 
Progestins also inhibit endometrial proliferation � endometrium is less suitable to the 
implantation of an embryo. 
Adverse effects: breakthrough menstrual bleeding, breast tenderness, VTE, hepatic adenomas.

NOTES
Embryonic  
(weeks 4–7)
Lung bud � trachea � bronchial buds 
� mainstem bronchi � secondary (lobar) 
bronchi � tertiary (segmental) bronchi.
Errors at this stage can lead to 
tracheoesophageal fistula.
Pseudoglandular 
(weeks 5–17)
Endodermal tubules � terminal bronchioles. 
Surrounded by modest capillary network.
Respiration impossible, incompatible with life.
Canalicular  
(weeks 16–25)
Terminal bronchioles � respiratory bronchioles 
� alveolar ducts. Surrounded by prominent 
capillary network.
Airways increase in diameter. Pneumocytes 
develop starting at week 20. Respiration 
capable at week 25.
Saccular  
(week 24–birth)
Alveolar ducts � terminal sacs. Terminal sacs 
separated by 1° septae. 
Alveolar  
(week 36–8 years)
Terminal sacs � adult alveoli (due to 2° 
septation). 
In utero, “breathing” occurs via aspiration and 
expulsion of amniotic fluid � � pulmonary

presents with upper airway obstruction, noisy 
breathing, and/or cyanosis that worsens during

by failure to pass nasopharyngeal tube and 
confirmed with CT scan.
Often part of multiple malformation syndromes,

Lung malformations
Pulmonary hypoplasia
Poorly developed bronchial tree with abnormal histology. Associated with congenital diaphragmatic 
hernia (usually left-sided), bilateral renal agenesis (Potter sequence).
Bronchogenic cysts
Caused by abnormal budding of the foregut and dilation of terminal or large bronchi. Discrete, 
round, sharply defined, fluid-filled densities on CXR (air-filled if infected). Generally 
asymptomatic but can drain poorly � airway compression, recurrent respiratory infections.
Club cells
Nonciliated; low columnar/cuboidal with secretory granules. Located in bronchioles. Degrade toxins 
via cytochrome P-450; secrete component of surfactant; progenitor cells for club and ciliated cells.
Alveolar cell types
Type I pneumocytes
Squamous. 97% of alveolar surfaces. Thinly line 
the alveoli A  for optimal gas exchange.
Pores of Kohn—anatomical communications 
between alveoli that allow for passing of air, 
fluid, phagocytes, and bacteria (in pneumonia).
Type II pneumocytes 
Cuboidal and clustered B . 2 functions:
1. Serve as stem cell precursors for 2 cell 
types (type I and type II pneumocytes); 
proliferate during lung damage.
2. Secrete surfactant from lamellar bodies 
(arrowheads in B ).
Application of Law of Laplace in alveoli–alveoli 
have � tendency to collapse on expiration as 
radius �.
Surfactant—� alveolar surface tension, � alveolar 
collapse, � lung recoil, and � compliance. 
Composed of multiple lecithins, mainly 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). 
Synthesis begins ~20 weeks of gestation and 
achieves mature levels ~35 weeks of gestation. 
Glucocorticoids important for fetal surfactant 
synthesis and lung development.
Collapsing pressure = 2 (surface tension)/radius
Alveolar macrophages

Respiratory tree
Conducting zone
Large airways consist of nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Airway resistance highest in 
the large- to medium-sized bronchi. Small airways consist of bronchioles that further divide into 
terminal bronchioles (large numbers in parallel � least airway resistance). 
Warms, humidifies, and filters air but does not participate in gas exchange � “anatomic dead space.”
Cartilage and goblet cells extend to the end of bronchi.
Pseudostratified ciliated columnar cells primarily make up epithelium of bronchus and extend to 
beginning of terminal bronchioles, then transition to cuboidal cells. Clear mucus and debris from 
lungs (mucociliary escalator).
Airway smooth muscle cells extend to end of terminal bronchioles (sparse beyond this point).
Respiratory zone
Lung parenchyma; consists of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Participates in gas 
exchange.
Mostly cuboidal cells in respiratory bronchioles, then simple squamous cells up to alveoli. Cilia 
terminate in respiratory bronchioles. Alveolar macrophages clear debris and participate in 
immune response.

Work of breathing 
Refers to the energy expended or O2 consumed by respiratory muscles to produce the ventilation 
needed to meet the body’s metabolic demand. Comprises the work needed to overcome both 
elastic recoil and airway resistance (ie, work = force × distance = pressure × volume). Minimized 
by optimizing respiratory rate (RR) and VT. � in restrictive diseases (� work to overcome elastic 
recoil achieved with � RR and � VT) and obstructive diseases (� work to overcome airway 
resistance achieved with � RR and � VT).

Elastic recoil
Tendency for lungs to collapse inward and chest 
wall to spring outward.
At FRC, airway and alveolar pressures equal 
atmospheric pressure (PB; called zero), and 
intrapleural pressure is negative (preventing 
atelectasis). The inward pull of the lung is 
balanced by the outward pull of the chest wall. 
System pressure is atmospheric. Pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR) is at a minimum.
Compliance
Change in lung volume for a change in pressure 
(ΔV/ΔP). Inversely proportional to wall stiffness 
and increased by surfactant.
 � � compliance = lung easier to fill (eg, 
emphysema, older adults)
 � � compliance = lung more difficult to fill 
(eg, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, ARDS, 
pulmonary edema)
Hysteresis
Lung inflation follows a different pressure-

to overcome surface tension forces in inflation.

Pulmonary circulation
Normally a low-resistance, high-compliance 
system. A � in Pao2 causes hypoxic 
vasoconstriction that shifts blood away from 
poorly ventilated regions of lung to well-
ventilated regions of lung.
Perfusion limited—O2 (normal health), CO2, 
N2O. Gas equilibrates early along the length of 
the capillary. Exchange can be � only if blood 
flow �.
Diffusion limited—O2 (emphysema, fibrosis), 
CO. Gas does not equilibrate by the time 
blood reaches the end of the capillary.
O2 diffuses slowly, while CO2 diffuses very 
rapidly across the alveolar membrane. Disease

Ventilation/perfusion

Ideally, ventilation (V) is matched to perfusion (Q) per minute (ie, 
 ratio = 1) for adequate gas 
exchange.
Lung zones:
 �
 at apex of lung = 3 (wasted ventilation)
 �
 at base of lung = 0.6 (wasted perfusion)
Both ventilation and perfusion are greater at the base of the lung than at the apex of the lung.
With exercise (� cardiac output), there is vasodilation of apical capillaries � 
 ratio approaches 1.
Certain organisms that thrive in high O2 (eg, TB) flourish in the apex.
 = 0 = “oirway” obstruction (shunt). In shunt, 100% O2 does not improve Pao2 (eg, foreign body 
aspiration).

Carbon dioxide 
transport
CO2 is transported from tissues to lungs in 3 forms:
1   HCO3
− (70%). HCO3
−/Cl− transporter on RBC membrane allows HCO3
− to diffuse out to 
plasma and Cl− to diffuse into RBC (chloride shift) via facilitated diffusion countertransport
2   Carbaminohemoglobin or HbCO2 (21–25%). CO2 bound to Hb at N-terminus of globin (not 
heme). CO2 favors deoxygenated form (O2 unloaded).
3   Dissolved CO2 (5–9%).
In lungs, oxygenation of Hb promotes dissociation of H+ from Hb. This shifts equilibrium toward 
CO2 formation; therefore, CO2 is released from RBCs (Haldane effect).
Majority of blood CO2 is carried as HCO3
− in the plasma.

Hemoglobin
Normal adult hemoglobin (Hb) is composed 
of 4 polypeptide subunits (2 α and 2 β) that 
each bind one O2 molecule. Hb is an allosteric 
protein that exhibits positive cooperativity 
when binding to O2, such that: 
 � Oxygenated Hb has high affinity for O2 
(300×).
 � Deoxygenated Hb has low affinity for 
O2 � promotes release/unloading of O2. 
The protein component of hemoglobin acts as 
buffer for H+ ions.
Myoglobin is composed of a single polypeptide 
chain associated with one heme moiety. 
Higher affinity for oxygen than Hb.

Oxygen content of 
blood
O2 content = (O2 bound to hemoglobin) + (O2 solubilized in plasma) = (1.34 × Hb × SaO2) + (0.003 
× PaO2).
SaO2 = percent saturation of arterial blood with O2.
0.003 = solubility constant of O2; PaO2 = partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood.
Normally 1 g Hb can bind 1.34 mL O2; normal Hb amount in blood is 15 g/dL. 
O2 binding (carrying) capacity ≈ 20 mL O2/dL of blood.

dissociation curve
Shifts in oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve 
(ODC) reflect local tissue oxygen needs. Can

chocolate-colored blood.
Dapsone, local anesthetics (eg, benzocaine),

Orbit
Max
Obstruction of sinus drainage into nasal cavity � inflammation and pain over affected area. 
Typically affects maxillary sinuses, which drain against gravity due to ostia located superomedially 
(red arrow points to fluid-filled right maxillary sinus in A ).
Superior meatus—drains posterior ethmoid; middle meatus—drains frontal, maxillary, and anterior 
ethmoid; inferior meatus—drains nasolacrimal duct.
Acute rhinosinusitis is most commonly caused by viruses (eg, rhinovirus); may lead to superimposed 
bacterial infection, most commonly nontypeable H influenzae, S pneumoniae, M catarrhalis.
Paranasal sinus infections may extend to the orbits, cavernous sinus, and brain, causing 
complications (eg, orbital cellulitis, cavernous sinus syndrome, meningitis).
Epistaxis
Nose bleed. Most commonly occurs in anterior 
segment of nostril (Kiesselbach plexus). Life-
threatening hemorrhages occur in posterior 
segment (sphenopalatine artery, a branch of 
maxillary artery). Common causes include 
foreign body, trauma, allergic rhinitis, and

tumors that develop independently after exposure.
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma may present with unilateral nasal obstruction, discharge, epistaxis. 
Eustachian tube obstruction may lead to otitis media +/– effusion, hearing loss.
Laryngeal papillomatosis—also called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Benign laryngeal 
tumor, commonly affecting areas of stratified squamous epithelium such as the true vocal cords, 
especially in children. Associated with HPV-6 and HPV-11.
Deep venous 
thrombosis

Blood clot within a deep vein � swelling, 
redness A , warmth, pain. Predisposed by 
Virchow triad (SHE):
 � Stasis (eg, post-op, long drive/flight)
 � Hypercoagulability (eg, defect in 
coagulation cascade proteins, such as 
factor V Leiden; oral contraceptive use; 
pregnancy)
 � Endothelial damage (exposed collagen 
triggers clotting cascade)
Most pulmonary emboli arise from proximal 
deep veins of lower extremity (iliac, femoral, 
popliteal veins).
d-dimer test may be used clinically to rule out 
DVT if disease probability is low or moderate 
(high sensitivity, low specificity).
Imaging test of choice is compression ultrasound 
with Doppler.
Use unfractionated heparin or low-molecular 
weight heparins (eg, enoxaparin) for 
prophylaxis and acute management.
Use direct anticoagulants (eg, rivaroxaban,

Pulmonary emboli
Obstruction of the pulmonary artery or its branches by foreign material (usually thrombus) that 
originated elsewhere. Affected alveoli are ventilated but not perfused (
 mismatch). May present 
with sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, respiratory 
alkalosis. Large emboli or saddle embolus (red arrows show filling defects in A) may cause sudden 
death due to clot preventing blood from filling LV and increased RV size further compromising 
LV filling (obstructive shock). CT pulmonary angiography is imaging test of choice for PE (look for 
filling defects) B . ECG may show sinus tachycardia or, less commonly, S1Q3T3 abnormality.
Lines of Zahn C  are interdigitating areas of pink (platelets, fibrin) and red (RBCs) found only in 
thrombi formed before death; help distinguish pre- and postmortem thrombi.
Treatment: anticoagulation (eg, heparin, direct thrombin/factor Xa inhibitors), IVC filter (if 
anticoagulation is contraindicated).
Types: Fat, Air, Thrombus, Bacteria, Amniotic fluid, Tumor. An embolus moves like a FAT BAT. 
Fat emboli—associated with long bone fractures and liposuction; classic triad of hypoxemia, 
neurologic abnormalities, petechial rash.
Air emboli—nitrogen bubbles precipitate in ascending divers (caisson disease/decompression sickness); 
treat with hyperbaric O2; or, can be iatrogenic 2° to invasive procedures (eg, central line placement).
Amniotic fluid emboli—typically occurs during labor or postpartum, but can be due to uterine 
trauma. Can lead to DIC. Rare, but high mortality.

Mediastinal masses
Some pathologies (eg, lymphoma, lung cancer, abscess) can occur in any compartment, but there 
are common associations:
 � Anterior—4 T’s: thyroid (substernal goiter), thymic neoplasm, teratoma, “terrible” lymphoma.
 � Middle—metastases, hiatal hernia, bronchogenic cysts.
 � Posterior—esophageal cancer (may present as mass in, or spread to, middle mediastinum), 
neurogenic tumor (eg, neurofibroma), multiple myeloma.
Mediastinitis
Inflammation of mediastinal tissues. Commonly due to postoperative complications of 
cardiothoracic procedures (≤ 14 days), esophageal perforation, or contiguous spread of 
odontogenic/retropharyngeal infection. 
Chronic mediastinitis—also called fibrosing mediastinitis; due to � proliferation of connective 
tissue in mediastinum. Histoplasma capsulatum is common cause.
Clinical features: fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, chest pain, and sternal wound drainage.
Pneumomediastinum
Presence of gas (usually air) in the mediastinum. Can either be spontaneous (due to rupture of 
pulmonary bleb) or 2° (eg, trauma, iatrogenic, Boerhaave syndrome).
Ruptured alveoli allow tracking of air into the mediastinum via peribronchial and perivascular sheaths.
Clinical features: chest pain, dyspnea, voice change, subcutaneous emphysema, ⊕ Hamman sign

PAThOPhYSIOlOgY
Alveolar insult � release of pro-inflammatory cytokines � neutrophil recruitment, activation, 
and release of toxic mediators (eg, reactive oxygen species, proteases, etc) � capillary endothelial 
damage and � vessel permeability � leakage of protein-rich fluid into alveoli � formation of 
intra-alveolar hyaline membranes (arrows in A ) and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (normal 
PCWP) � � compliance and 
 mismatch � hypoxic vasoconstriction � � pulmonary  
vascular resistance.
Loss of surfactant also contributes to alveolar collapse (eg, preterm infants, drowning).
CAUSES
Sepsis (most common), aspiration pneumonia, burns, trauma, pancreatitis, drowning injuries.
DIAgNOSIS
Diagnosis of exclusion with the following criteria (ARDS):
 � Abnormal chest X-ray (bilateral lung opacities) B
 � Respiratory failure within 1 week of alveolar insult
 � Decreased PaO2/FIO2 (ratio < 300, hypoxemia due to � intrapulmonary shunting and diffusion 
abnormalities)
 � Symptoms of respiratory failure are not due to HF/fluid overload
CONSEQUENCES

Atelectasis
A
Alveolar collapse (right upper lobe collapse against mediastinum in A ). Multiple causes:
 � Obstructive—airway obstruction prevents new air from reaching distal airways, old air is 
resorbed (eg, foreign body, mucous plug, tumor)
 � Compressive—external compression on lung decreases lung volumes (eg, space-occupying 
lesion, pleural effusion)
 � Contraction (cicatrization)—scarring of lung parenchyma that distorts alveoli (eg, sarcoidosis)

` HOW TO USE THE DATABASE
This section is a database of top-rated basic science review books, sample 
examination books, websites, apps, and commercial review courses that 
have been marketed to medical students studying for the USMLE Step 1. 
For each recommended resource, we list (where applicable) the Title, the 
First Author (or editor), the Series Name (where applicable), the Current 
Publisher, the Copyright Year, the Number of Pages, the ISBN, the 
Approximate List Price, the Format of the resource, and the Number of 
Test Questions. We also include Summary Comments that describe their 
style and overall utility for studying. Finally, each recommended resource 
receives a Rating. Within each section, resources are arranged first by Rating 
and then alphabetically by the first author within each Rating group.
A letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student 
evaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as 
follows:
A+ 
Excellent for boards review.
A 
A− 
Very good for boards review; choose among the group.
B+ 
 
B 
Good, but use only after exhausting better resources.
B− 
 Fair, but there are many better resources in the discipline; or low-
yield subject material.
The Rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in 
helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a 
number of factors, including:
 
� The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1
 
� The appropriateness and accuracy of the material
 
� The readability of the text
 
� The quality and number of sample questions
 
� The quality of written answers to sample questions
 
� The cost
 
� The quality of the user interface and learning experience, for web and 
mobile apps
 
� The quality and appropriateness of the images and illustrations
 
� The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better)
 
� The quality and number of other resources available in the same 
discipline
Please note that ratings do not reflect the quality of the resources for 
purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 1. Many books with 
lower ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for boards

preparation. We have not listed or commented on general textbooks 
available for the basic sciences.
Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal 
surveys of thousands of medical students at many medical schools across the 
country. The summary comments and overall ratings represent a consensus 
opinion, but there may have been a broad range of opinion or limited 
student feedback on any particular resource.
Please note that the data listed are subject to change in that:
 
� Publisher and app store prices change frequently.
 
� Retail and online bookstores may set their own prices.
 
� New editions and app versions come out frequently, and the quality of 
updating varies.
 
� The same book may be reissued through another publisher.
We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit their opinions 
and ratings of these basic science review materials so that we may update 
our database. In addition, we ask that publishers and authors submit for 
evaluation review copies of basic science review books, including new 
editions and books not included in our database. We also solicit reviews 
of new books, mobile apps, websites, flash cards, and commercial review 
courses.
Disclaimer/Conflict of Interest Statement
None of the ratings reflects the opinion or influence of the publisher. All 
errors and omissions will gladly be corrected if brought to the attention 
of the authors through our blog at firstaidteam.com. Please note that 
USMLE-Rx, ScholarRx, and the entire First Aid for the USMLE series 
are publications by certain authors of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1; the 
following ratings are based solely on recommendations from the student 
authors of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 as well as data from the student 
survey and feedback forms.
